Python Basics

Why Python?
Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages. It's also versatile, used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and more. Python has a huge community and many libraries to help you build almost anything.

Variables
A variable is like a box with a name. You put something inside the box, like a number or a word. The name on the box helps you find what's inside later.

Variable Naming Rules:
First, variable names must start with a letter or an underscore. For example: `name` or `_score`.
You cannot start a variable name with a number, so `1age` is not allowed. However, names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores after the first character. For example: `age1` or `student_name`.
No spaces are allowed in variable names. Use an underscore instead of a space. For example, `first_name` is correct, but `first name` is wrong.
You cannot use Python's reserved keywords. Words like `if`, `for`, `while`, or `class` cannot be variable names.
Variable names are case-sensitive. `Age` and `age` are considered different variables.
Finally, keep names meaningful. Use names that describe what the variable holds, such as `score` or `student_age`.

For example:
```
name = "Sprout"
student = 900
```
The `name` box holds the text "Sprout".
The `student` box holds the number nine hundred.
You can use the box's name to get its value. For instance, `print("Hello, " + name)` would output:
```
Hello, Sprout
```

How to Initialize a Variable Using the Assignment Operator
First, choose a variable name. Then, use the assignment operator, which is the equals sign, to give it a value.

Syntax:
```
Variable_name = value
```
Example:
```
name = "Sprout"
location = "Coimbatore"
age = 6
```
Explanation:
This stores the word "Sprout" in the variable `name`.
It stores the word "Coimbatore" in the variable `location`.
And it stores the number six in the variable `age`.

AI Tutor Questions
For Critical Thinking: What might happen if you reuse a variable name by accident? Try it and observe.
For Creativity: Create a profile card with name, age, and favorite color using variables.
For Communication: Explain to a friend why variable names shouldn't start with a number.
For Collaboration: Work with a peer. One person writes code for name and age, and the other adds hobbies.

Data Types
What Are Data Types?
When we create a variable, Python needs to know what kind of value is stored inside. That "kind" is called a data type.

Imagine a school bag. If you put books in it, it becomes a book bag. If you put snacks in it, it becomes a lunch bag. In Python, the type of value decides the data type of the variable.

Here's a table describing common data types with examples:
An `int`, short for integer, represents whole numbers, such as five, minus ten, or zero.
A `float` represents decimal numbers, like three point one four, or minus zero point five.
A `bool`, short for boolean, represents `True` or `False` values.
And `str`, short for string, represents text data, like "Hello" or "one two three".

Syntax:
```
variable_name = value
```

Integer, or `int`
What is an Integer?
An integer is a whole number, with no decimals. It can be positive, such as five or one hundred; negative, like minus seven or minus twenty-two; or zero.

Syntax:
```
variable_name = integer_value
```
Example Program:
```
age = 5
year = 2020
print("Age:", age)
print("Year:", year)
```
Explanation:
`age` equals five: we're storing a whole number in the variable `age`, so that's an integer.
`year` equals two thousand twenty: years are whole numbers, so again this is an integer.
We use the `print()` function to display these values.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: Why would using a float instead of an integer cause issues when you're counting people in a classroom?
For Creativity: Design a small student info card using integers like `roll_number`, `age`, and `grade`. Print the values and share it.
For Communication: If a user enters their age as a float, for example, ten point five, how would you explain to them why the system needs an integer?
For Collaboration: Work with a friend to create a program that accepts a student's roll number and age, then prints a welcome message.

Float, or Decimal Numbers
What is a Float?
A float is a number that has a decimal point. Examples include three point one four, zero point five, and minus seven point two five. We use floats when we need precision, such as for money, temperature, or measurements.

Syntax:
```
variable_name = decimal_value
```
Example Program:
```
price = 49.99
temperature = -2.5
height = 5.8
print("Price:", price)
print("Temperature:", temperature)
print("Height:", height)
```
Explanation:
`price` equals forty-nine point nine nine: this is a float because it has a decimal, useful when dealing with money.
`temperature` equals minus two point five: even though it's negative, it's still a float because of the decimal point.
`height` equals five point eight: height is often measured in decimal points, so float makes sense here.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What problems might occur if you use an integer instead of a float for calculating someone's body temperature?
For Creativity: Create a mini shopping list using float values, for example, `price` equals forty-nine point nine nine, `discount` equals five point five. Calculate and print the final price.
For Communication: Explain to someone new to programming why three point zero and three are stored differently in memory.
For Collaboration: Pair up and create a weather report generator that stores today's temperature, humidity, and wind speed using floats.

Boolean, representing True or False values
What is a Boolean?
A Boolean is a special data type that has only two possible values: `True` or `False`. We use it for decisions, such as: is a student present? Has the user logged in? Or is the number greater than ten?

Syntax:
```
variable_name = True
```
or
```
variable_name = False
```
Example Program:
```
is_logged_in = True
is_holiday = False
passed_exam = True
print("User logged in:", is_logged_in)
print("Is today a holiday?", is_holiday)
print("Passed the exam:", passed_exam)
```
Explanation:
`is_logged_in` equals True: the user has logged in, so it's `True`.
`is_holiday` equals False: today is not a holiday, so we mark it as `False`.
`passed_exam` equals True: this student passed, so we store it as `True`.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: How does using Boolean values help in deciding whether a user should be allowed to access a page or not?
For Creativity: Write a program that checks if someone is eligible for a prize based on `has_coupon` equals True. What other conditions might you add?
For Communication: How would you explain the difference between using a single equals sign and a double equals sign when working with Boolean conditions?
For Collaboration: Work with a peer to write a login check. Store `is_logged_in` as False, and later change it to True, then show the status.

Strings
What is a String?
A string is simply a sequence of characters, like words or sentences, enclosed inside quotes. It can contain letters, numbers, and symbols. You can think of a string like a sentence written on a ribbon. Each character has a specific position, called an index, and you can pull characters out or change them around.

Creating a String
Syntax:
```
text = "sprout"
```
or
```
text = 'Brighter tomorrow'
```
Example:
```
greeting = "Welcome to sprout"
print(greeting)
```
Output:
```
Welcome to sprout
```
Explanation:
The variable `greeting` stores a message, which is a string. The `print()` function displays it.

String Indexing
Each character in a string has a position number, called an index, starting from zero.
Example:
```
word = "Sprout"
print(word[0])  # First letter
print(word[5])  # Last letter
```
Output:
```
S
t
```
Explanation:
`word` at index zero gives the first character.
`word` at index five gives the sixth character, because indexing starts from zero.

String Slicing
You can cut out parts of a string using slicing.
Syntax:
```
string[start:end]
```
Example:
```
msg = "HelloSprout"
print(msg[0:5])  # From index 0 to 4
```
Output:
```
Hello
```
Explanation:
This starts from index zero and goes up to, but does not include, index five.

Common String Methods
Python provides many built-in methods to work with strings.
Here are some common string methods and their descriptions:
`lower()` converts a string to lowercase.
`upper()` converts to uppercase.
`strip()` removes spaces at the ends of a string.
`replace()` replaces part of the string.
`split()` breaks a string into a list.
`find()` finds the index of a character.
`len()` returns the length of a string.

Example Program Using String Methods:
```
name = " Python Programming "
1. print(name.strip())  # Removes spaces
2. print(name.lower())  # Lowercase
3. print(name.upper())  # Uppercase
4. print(name.replace("Python", "Java"))  # Replace word
5. print(len(name))  # Count characters including spaces
```
Output:
```
1. Python Programming
2. python programming
3. PYTHON PROGRAMMING
4. Java Programming
5. 24
```

f-Strings, or Formatted Strings
These are used to combine variables with strings in a neat way.
Example:
```
name = "Sprout"
age = 5
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```
Output:
```
My name is sprout and I am 5 years old.
```
Explanation:
The `f` before the string tells Python it's an f-string, allowing you to place variables inside curly braces.

AI Tutor Questions
For Critical Thinking: What will happen if you try to add a string and an integer directly? Try it and fix the error.
For Creativity: Write a creative welcome message by combining three different string variables.
For Communication: Teach a peer how escape characters like backslash `n` for newline and backslash `t` for tab work, using examples.
For Collaboration: Collaborate with a friend to build a small story using multiple strings joined together creatively.

Operators
Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Think of them as action signs, like the plus sign for addition, or the double equals sign for checking if two things are equal.

Types of Operators:

First, Arithmetic Operators.
These are used for basic math operations:
The plus sign `+` for addition.
The minus sign `-` for subtraction.
The asterisk `*` for multiplication.
The slash `/` for division.
The percent sign `%` for modulus, which gives the remainder.
Double asterisks `**` for exponent, or power.
Double slashes `//` for floor division, which is division rounded down.

Syntax:
`a + b` adds two numbers.
`a - b` subtracts `b` from `a`.
`a * b` multiplies `a` and `b`.
`a / b` divides `a` by `b`. The result can be a decimal.
`a % b` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.
`a ** b` raises `a` to the power of `b`.
`a // b` divides `a` by `b` and gives only the whole number part.

Example program:
```
x = 15
y = 4
```
If `x` is fifteen and `y` is four:
Addition, `x + y`, would be nineteen.
Subtraction, `x - y`, would be eleven.
Multiplication, `x * y`, would be sixty.
Division, `x / y`, would be three point seven five.
Modulus, `x % y`, which gives the remainder, would be three.
Exponent, `x ** y`, which is fifteen to the power of four, would be fifty thousand six hundred twenty-five.
And floor division, `x // y`, would be three, as it gives only the whole number part.

Second, Comparison Operators.
These are used to compare two values and return either `True` or `False`.
Double equals sign `==` checks if two values are equal to each other.
Exclamation mark equals sign `!=` checks if they are not equal.
Greater than sign `>` checks if one is greater than another.
Less than sign `<` checks if one is less than another.
Greater than or equals sign `>=` checks if one is greater than or equal to another.
Less than or equals sign `<=` checks if one is less than or equal to another.

Syntax:
`a == b` checks if `a` is equal to `b`.
`a != b` checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
`a > b` checks if `a` is greater than `b`.
`a < b` checks if `a` is less than `b`.
`a >= b` checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
`a <= b` checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

Example program:
```
x = 10
y = 20
equal = (x == y)
not_equal = (x != y)
greater = (x > y)
less = (x < y)
greater_equal = (x >= y)
less_equal = (x <= y)
```
Explanation:
`equal` checks if ten is the same as twenty. Since they are different, the result is `False`.
`not_equal` checks if ten is different from twenty. Since they are different, the result is `True`.
`greater` checks if ten is bigger than twenty. It's not, so the result is `False`.
`less` checks if ten is smaller than twenty. It is, so the result is `True`.
`greater_equal` checks if ten is bigger or the same as twenty. It's not, so the result is `False`.
`less_equal` checks if ten is smaller or the same as twenty. Since ten is smaller, the result is `True`.

Third, Logical Operators.
These are used to combine conditional statements:
The `and` operator returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.
The `or` operator returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.
The `not` operator reverses the result.

Syntax:
`a and b` is `True` if both `a` and `b` are `True`.
`a or b` is `True` if either `a` or `b` is `True`.
`not a` is `True` if `a` is `False`, and `False` if `a` is `True`. It reverses the boolean value.

Example:
```
x = True
y = False
and_result = x and y
or_result = x or y
not_result = not x
```
Explanation:
`and_result` asks: "Are both `x` and `y` True?" Here, `x` is `True` but `y` is `False`, so the answer is `False`, because both must be `True` for the `and` operator to be `True`.
`or_result` asks: "Is either `x` or `y` True?" Since `x` is `True`, it doesn't matter what `y` is. The `or` operator returns `True` if any one condition is `True`.
`not_result` flips the value of `x`. Since `x` is `True`, `not x` becomes `False`. It's like saying "not True equals False".

Fourth, Assignment Operators.
These are used to assign or update values.
The single equals sign `=` for simple assignment.
Plus equals `+=` to add and assign.
Minus equals `-=` to subtract and assign.
Asterisk equals `*=` to multiply and assign.
Slash equals `/=` to divide and assign.
Percent equals `%=` to get modulus and assign.

Syntax:
`a = b` assigns the value of `b` to `a`.
`a += b` adds `b` to `a`, then assigns the result to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a + b`.
`a -= b` subtracts `b` from `a`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a - b`.
`a *= b` multiplies `a` by `b`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a * b`.
`a /= b` divides `a` by `b`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a / b`.
`a %= b` takes the modulus of `a` by `b`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a % b`.
`a **= b` raises `a` to the power of `b`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a ** b`.
`a //= b` performs floor division of `a` by `b`, then assigns to `a`. This is equivalent to `a = a // b`.

Example program:
```
a = 10
a += 5  # Now a becomes 10 + 5 = 15
a -= 3  # Now a becomes 15 - 3 = 12
a *= 2  # Now a becomes 12 * 2 = 24
a /= 4  # Now a becomes 24 / 4 = 6.0
a %= 4  # Now a becomes 6.0 % 4 = 2.0
```
Explanation:
`a` equals ten means we start by giving the value ten to variable `a`.
`a += 5` means "add five to `a`" and update `a` with this new value, so `a` becomes fifteen.
`a -= 3` means "subtract three from `a`" and update `a`, so now `a` is twelve.
`a *= 2` means "multiply `a` by two" and update `a` to twenty-four.
`a /= 4` means "divide `a` by four" and update `a` to six point zero. Notice it becomes a float.
`a %= 4` means "get the remainder when `a` is divided by four" and update `a` to two point zero.

Identity Operators
These operators check if two variables point to the same object in memory.
The `is` operator returns `True` if two variables refer to the exact same object.
The `is not` operator returns `True` if they do not refer to the same object.

Syntax:
`a is b` is `True` if `a` and `b` refer to the same object.
`a is not b` is `True` if `a` and `b` do NOT refer to the same object.

Example program:
```
x = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]
y = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]
z = x
print(x is y)     # False
print(x is z)     # True
print(x is not y) # True
```
Explanation:
`x` and `y` have the same contents, but they are different objects in memory, so `x is y` evaluates to `False`.
`z` is assigned to `x`, so both `z` and `x` point to the same object, making `x is z` evaluate to `True`.
Since `x` and `y` are not the same object, `x is not y` evaluates to `True`.

Fifth, Membership Operators.
These operators check if a value is present in a sequence, such as a list or a string.
The `in` operator returns `True` if the value is present.
The `not in` operator returns `True` if the value is not present.

Syntax:
`item in sequence` is `True` if the `item` is found inside the `sequence`.
`item not in sequence` is `True` if the `item` is NOT found inside the `sequence`.

Example program:
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)      # True
print("mango" in fruits)       # False
print("grape" not in fruits)   # True
```
Explanation:
`"banana" in fruits` checks if the string 'banana' is inside the list `fruits`. Since it is, the answer is `True`.
`"mango" in fruits` asks if the string 'mango' is in the list. It's not there, so the answer is `False`.
`"grape" not in fruits` asks if the string 'grape' is NOT in the list. Because it's not present, this is `True`.

Control Flow
Control flow helps your program decide which code to run based on conditions. It's like making choices!

The if-else statement.
Syntax:
```
if condition:
    # code to run if condition is True
else:
    # code to run if condition is False
```
Example program:
```
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You eligible not to vote.")
```
Explanation:
The program checks if `age` is eighteen or more.
If `True`, it prints: "You are eligible to vote."
If `False`, it prints: "You eligible not to vote."

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: Why do you think Python uses indentation instead of curly braces, like other languages?
Creativity: Design a program that checks if a person is eligible for a game based on age and score.
Communication: How would you explain the concept of if-elif-else to a ten-year-old using a daily example?
Collaboration: With a partner, write a program that checks if today is a holiday, a weekend, or a working day.

Nested if statements.
You can put an `if` statement inside another `if`. This is called a nested `if` statement.
Syntax:
```
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # code if both conditions are True
```
Example program:
```
age = 20
is_registered = True
if age >= 18:
    if is_registered:
        print("You are eligible to vote.")
    else:
        print("You need to register to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
```
Explanation:
First, it checks if the person is eighteen or older, which is the voting age.
If yes, it then checks if they are registered to vote.
If registered, it prints: "You are eligible to vote."
If not registered, it reminds them to register.
If under eighteen, it says they are not eligible yet.

AI Tutor Questions:

Creativity: Design a game scenario where two conditions decide the next level.
Communication: Explain how nesting works with a real-world analogy, like school grades and age.
Collaboration: Partner one writes the outer `if` statement, and Partner two writes a nested logic for eligibility.

The Ternary Operator, or short if-else.
When you want a quick decision in a single line, use the ternary operator.
Syntax:
```
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```
Example program:
```
age = 16
message = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(message)
```
Explanation:
It checks if `age` is eighteen or more.
If yes, `message` becomes "Adult".
If no, `message` becomes "Minor".
Then it prints the message.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: When would a ternary operator be better than a full if-else statement?
Creativity: Create a ternary check that returns "Pass" or "Fail" based on marks.
Communication: Convert a ternary into a normal if-else statement and explain both versions.
Collaboration: One person writes the ternary version, and the other writes the regular version. Then, compare them.

Loops
Loops help you repeat a block of code, either a specific number of times or until a condition is met.

The `while` Loop.
Use a `while` loop when you don't know exactly how many times to repeat. It just keeps going as long as its condition is `True`.
Syntax:
```
while condition:
    # code to repeat
```
Example:
```
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1
```
Explanation:
Start with `count` equals one.
The loop checks: Is `count` less than or equal to five?
If yes, it prints the value and increases `count` by one.
This repeats until `count` becomes six, then it stops.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What would happen if you forget to update the counter in a `while` loop? Try it.
Creativity: Make a pattern printer using nested loops, for example, a triangle of stars.
Communication: Explain to a beginner how `break` and `continue` affect loop flow with examples.
Collaboration: One person writes a `for` loop that lists numbers, and the other adds logic to skip odd numbers.

The `for` Loop.
Use a `for` loop when you know how many times you want to repeat, often with a list or a range of numbers.
Syntax:
```
for variable in sequence:
    # code to repeat
```
Example program:
```
for i in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", i)
```
Explanation:
`range` from one to six gives numbers from one to five.
Each time, `i` takes the next number.
It prints `i` from one to five.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What happens if your `range` is off-by-one? Can you fix an off-by-one error?
Creativity: Make a countdown from ten to one using a `for` loop.
Communication: Teach a friend how `range` with `start` and `stop` works with an example.
Collaboration: One person writes a loop printing even numbers; the other handles odd numbers.

The `break` statement.
`break` is used to stop a loop early when a condition is met.
Example:
```
for i in range(1, 10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```
Explanation: This loop prints numbers starting from one. But when `i` becomes five, `break` stops the loop. The output will be one, two, three, four.

The `continue` statement.
`continue` is used to skip the current loop step and move to the next one.
Example:
```
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue
    print(i)
```
Explanation: This prints numbers from one to five. But when `i` is three, it skips printing and goes to the next number. The output will be one, two, four, five; three is skipped.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What would happen if `continue` is placed before a critical print statement?
Creativity: Use `continue` to skip printing vowels from a word.
Communication: Explain the role of `continue` in controlling loop behavior.
Collaboration: One person writes the loop, the other adds `continue` to handle a specific condition.

`else` with Loops.
You can use an `else` block after a loop. It runs only if the loop completes normally, meaning it was not stopped by a `break` statement.
Example:
```
for i in range(1, 4):
    print("Checking:", i)
else:
    print("Loop completed.")
```
Explanation: It prints numbers one to three. Then, since the loop finished without a `break`, the `else` block runs. The output ends with "Loop completed."

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What happens if you add a `break` inside a loop with an `else` block?
Creativity: Build a number search loop with an `else` block that says: "Not found!"
Communication: Explain how a loop's `else` differs from an `if-else` statement.
Collaboration: One person writes a loop to find a number, and the other adds an `else` block for a post-loop message.

Functions
Functions are like mini programs inside your main program. You write the code once, give it a name, and then reuse it anytime by "calling" it.

`def` and `return`
Syntax:
```
def function_name():
    # code inside the function
    return result
```
Example:
```
def greet():
    return "Hello, sprout"
message = greet()
print(message)
```
Explanation:
`def greet():` creates a function named `greet`.
`return "Hello, welcome!"` sends back a message when the function is called.
`greet()` is called and the result is stored in `message`.
Then we print it.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: Why use functions instead of repeating the same code in multiple places? Give an example.
Creativity: Create a `describe_pet` function that prints information based on the name and type of a pet.
Communication: Teach someone how to define and call a function using your own simple example.
Collaboration: One person writes a function to calculate squares of numbers, and the other adds input logic and testing.

Functions with Parameters.
You can pass values, called parameters, into a function.
Syntax:
```
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
```
Example:
```
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
greet("sprout")
```
Explanation:
The function expects a value called `name`.
When you call `greet("sprout")`, it prints: "Hello, sprout".

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: What happens if you forget to pass one of the required arguments to a function?
Creativity: Design a `make_card` function that takes a `name` and `age` and prints a greeting card message.
Communication: Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument to a peer.
Collaboration: One partner writes a function with two parameters, and the other tests it with various values.

Asterisk args, for a variable number of arguments.
Use `*args` to send a list of values to a function.
Syntax:
```
def add_numbers(*args):
    # args behaves like a tuple
```
Example:
```
def add_numbers(*args):
    total = 0
    for num in args:
        total += num
    return total
print(add_numbers(10, 20, 30))
```
Explanation:
`*args` allows the function to accept any number of values.
It adds ten plus twenty plus thirty and returns sixty.

Double asterisk kwargs, for keyword arguments.
Use `**kwargs` to pass values with names, or keys.
Example:
```
def print_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(key, ":", value)
print_info(name="Sprout", age=6)
```
Explanation:
`**kwargs` lets you pass data like a dictionary with key-value pairs.
Here, `name="Sprout"` and `age=6` are passed to the function.
The function prints each key-value pair.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Q1: How does using `*args` help when you don't know how many arguments you'll need?
Follow-up: Can you create a function that takes in any number of scores and returns their average?
For Q2: Collaborate on writing a flexible report generator using `**kwargs`. Try different inputs and discuss.

For Critical Thinking: Why would using `*args` or `**kwargs` be better than fixed parameters in some cases? Give an example.
Creativity: Create a `log_event` function that uses `**kwargs` to log events with keys like `user`, `time`, and `action`.
Communication: Explain to a friend the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs` using your own analogy.
Collaboration: One student writes a function using `*args`, another adds `**kwargs`, and they combine use cases.

Lambda Functions, or short one-line functions.
Use a `lambda` function when you want a small, one-time function.
Syntax:
```
lambda arguments: expression
```
Example:
```
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5))
```
Explanation:
`lambda x: x * x` creates a small function to square a number.
`square(5)` returns twenty-five.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: Compare a regular function with a `lambda` function. When should you use each one?
Creativity: Create a `lambda` function that takes a number and returns "Even" or "Odd".
Communication: Teach your partner how to convert a normal function into a `lambda` function using a simple example.
Collaboration: One student writes a `lambda` function to sort a list of names; the other provides test cases.

Variable Scope: Local and Global.
Variables defined inside functions are local, meaning they can't be used outside that function.
Example:
```
def my_func():
    x = 10
    print("Inside:", x)
my_func()
print("Outside:", x)  # This will cause an error
```
Explanation:
`x = 10` is created inside the function.
When you try to use it outside, Python gives an error.
It means variables have a scope, or an area of life.

AI Tutor Questions:
For Critical Thinking: Why might using too many global variables lead to errors in a big program? Give an example.
Creativity: Write a small game setup function where a local variable holds the player's name and prints it.
Communication: Explain to a friend how local and global variables differ. Use your own example.
Collaboration: One student writes a global variable; the other writes a function to modify it using the `global` keyword.
