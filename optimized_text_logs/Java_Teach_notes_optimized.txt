Data Types in Java.
Introduction.
Before we write programs in Java, we must understand something very important: what type of data are we storing?
In programming, data types define three things: first, what kind of value a variable can store; second, how much memory it uses; and third, what operations can be performed.

Java is a strongly typed language. This means you must declare the data type before using a variable. Unlike Python, Java does not guess the type automatically.

What is a Data Type?
A data type tells the computer, "What type of value am I storing?"
For example: the number ten is an integer; three point one four is a decimal; the letter A is a character; the word true is a boolean; and the word "Hello" is a string.
In Java, we must clearly specify this.

For example, if you write: `int age = 20;`
Here, "int" is the data type, "age" is the variable name, and "twenty" is the value.

Types of Data Types in Java.
Java has two main categories: Primitive Data Types and Non-Primitive Data Types.
Primitive types store the actual value. Non-Primitive types store a reference, which is a memory address.
Now, let us understand primitive types first.

Primitive Data Types.
Java has eight primitive data types. Let us learn them one by one.
First, `byte`. This is used to store small whole numbers. Its size is one byte, and its range is from minus one hundred twenty-eight to one hundred twenty-seven.
For example: `byte number = 100;`
It's used when memory saving is important.

Next, `short`. This is slightly larger than a byte, with a size of two bytes.
For example: `short value = 10000;`

Then we have `int`, which is the most common. It's used for whole numbers and has a size of four bytes. It's the most commonly used integer type.
For instance: `int age = 25;`
Usually, we use `int` for normal numbers.

For very large numbers, we use `long`. Its size is eight bytes.
An example would be: `long population = 8000000000L;`
Notice that we add an uppercase L at the end of the number.

Moving on to `float`. This is used for decimal numbers and has a size of four bytes.
For example: `float price = 99.99f;`
It's important to remember that we must add an 'f' at the end of the number.

Then `double`, which is the most common for decimals. It's also used for decimal numbers but has a size of eight bytes, making it more precise than `float`.
For instance: `double salary = 45678.89;`
Most developers prefer `double`.

Next is `char`, which stores a single character. It uses single quotes and has a size of two bytes.
An example is: `char grade = 'A';`
It's important to note that only one character is allowed.

Finally, `boolean`. This stores either `true` or `false` and is used for conditions.
For example: `boolean isActive = true;`

Non-Primitive Data Types.
Non-primitive types include String, Arrays, Classes, and Objects.
For example: `String name = "Rakshitha";`
It's important to remember that primitive types store the actual value, while non-primitive types store a memory reference.

Type Casting.
Sometimes we convert one data type to another. There are two types.
First, Widening, which is automatic. This is when you convert a small type to a bigger type.
For example: `int x = 10;` then `double y = x;`
In this case, there is no data loss.
Second, Narrowing, which is manual. This is when you convert a bigger type to a smaller type.
For example: `double a = 10.5;` then `int b = (int) a;`
Here, the decimal part is removed.

Mini Practice Activity.
Create a Java program with five variables: an `int` for age, a `double` for height, a `char` for grade, a `boolean` for `isStudent`, and a `String` for name.
Then, print all these values.
Here's an example:
`int age = 20;`
`double height = 5.8;`
`char grade = 'A';`
`boolean isStudent = true;`
`String name = "Ravi";`
Then, you would print them using `System.out.println` statements like:
`System.out.println("Name: " + name);`
`System.out.println("Age: " + age);`
`System.out.println("Height: " + height);`
`System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);`
`System.out.println("Student: " + isStudent);`

Summary.
Today we learned: what a data type is, that Java is strongly typed, about the eight primitive data types, non-primitive types, and type casting.
Now you understand how Java stores data internally.
In the next lesson, we will learn about operators in Java.
