This session is about communication. Our objective is that by the end of this session, students will be able to introduce themselves confidently, clearly, and in a structured manner, without memorizing.

**Part One: Demonstration**
Let's begin with a model introduction. The narrator will now deliver an example.

"Good morning everyone. My name is Aparna. I am from Chennai. I work as an English trainer. I have been training students for the past five years. I am passionate about helping students improve their communication skills. My goal is to help each one of you become confident speakers. Thank you."

*Pause.*

Now, let's ask a few questions. Did you notice I spoke slowly? Did you notice I paused after every sentence? Did you notice I used simple English?

It's important to understand this: Fluency does not mean speed. Fluency means clarity.

**Part Two: Structure Explanation**
Let's outline the structure. The basic structure for an introduction is:
Greeting
Name
Place
Education or Profession
One Interest
Goal
Closing

Let's explain each step clearly.

**Step One: Greeting**
Say "Good morning" or "Good afternoon."

**Step Two: Name**
Say, "My name is Ravi." Do not say, "Myself Ravi."

**Step Three: Place**
For example, "I am from Coimbatore."

**Step Four: Education or Profession**
If you are a school student, say: "I am studying in tenth standard."
If you are a college student, say: "I am pursuing Bachelor of Science, Computer Science, second year."
If you are working, say: "I work as a software developer."

**Step Five: One Interest**
Mention only one interest.

**Step Six: Goal**
For example, "My goal is to become a confident speaker."

**Step Seven: Closing**
Always end with "Thank you."

**Part Three: Live Mistake Demonstration**
Now, let's demonstrate a common incorrect version. Listen carefully.

"Myself Ravi. I am coming from Coimbatore. My hobbies are cricket, dancing, singing, reading books, watching movies. Sorry for my bad English."

Let's correct it step by step.

**Correction One:**
Do not say "Myself Ravi." The correct way is: "My name is Ravi."

**Correction Two:**
Do not say "I am coming from." The correct way is: "I am from."

**Correction Three:**
Do not list too many hobbies. Mention only one.

**Correction Four:**
Never start or end with an apology. Confidence comes first.

Remember why clarity is more important than complicated words.

**Part Four: Three Sample Introductions**
Here are three sample introductions.

**Example One: A School Student**
"Good morning. My name is Karthik. I am studying in ninth standard. I am interested in science. My goal is to become a doctor. Thank you."

**Example Two: A College Student**
"Good afternoon. My name is Priya. I am pursuing Bachelor of Commerce, second year. I am interested in finance. My goal is to work in a reputed company. Thank you."

**Example Three: A Working Professional**
"Good morning. My name is Arun. I work as a software engineer. I am interested in learning new technologies. My goal is to grow in my career. Thank you."

Notice the differences in each example.

**Part Five: Daily Routine Speaking Practice**
Let's learn a simple structure for describing your daily routine: morning, then afternoon, then evening.

Here's a model answer:
"In the morning, I wake up at six a.m. and get ready for school. In the afternoon, I attend my classes and complete assignments. In the evening, I spend time with my family and revise my lessons."

When practicing, remember: do not overthink. Describe what you actually did. Add details like time and activities.

**Part Six: Confidence and Body Language**
Let's talk about confidence and body language.
*   Maintain eye contact.
*   Stand straight.
*   Do not rush.
*   Pause naturally.
*   Do not memorize like a robot.
*   Avoid looking at the floor.

If you feel nervous, remember that nervousness is normal. Confidence comes after repetition.

For practice, students should rehearse once, slowly.

**Session Summary**
Self-introduction is your first impression. Keep it short. Keep it structured. Speak clearly. End confidently.

Remember this formula: Simple English, plus Clear Structure, plus Confidence, equals Strong Communication.
