Lesson: What is Python and Variables in Python

Introduction

Hello everyone. Welcome to Kairos AI Learning. Today, we are going to start our Python journey. In this session, we will understand what Python is, why it is important, and what variables are in Python. Let’s begin.

What is Programming?

Before learning Python, we must understand something important: What is programming? Programming means giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks. For example: display a message, calculate total marks, store student details, build a website, or create a chatbot.

A computer does not understand human language. It understands instructions written in a programming language. That language acts as a bridge between humans and computers. Python is one such language.

What is Python?

Python is a high-level programming language. High-level means it is easy for humans to read and understand. Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.

Why is Python popular?

Python is popular due to its simple and readable syntax, requiring fewer lines of code, its huge global community, and its use in modern technologies.

Python is used in web development, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, automation, and game development. When you learn Python, you are learning a powerful, industry-level skill.

Your First Python Program

Let us write our first Python program. We'll type: `print` (open parenthesis, quote, "Hello World", close quote, close parenthesis).

Explanation: The `print()` function is a built-in function. "Hello World" is a string, and quotes are used to represent text.

The output will be: Hello World.

If we write `print` (ten), it prints the number ten.

Important: Text requires quotes. Numbers do not require quotes.

What is a Variable?

A variable is a container used to store data. Think of it like a labeled box.

Example: `age` equals twenty.

Here, `age` is the variable name. The equals sign is the assignment operator, and twenty is the value stored.

Now we can use it. If we `print` (age), the output will be twenty.

Variable Naming Rules

Here are some important rules.

First, a variable must start with a letter or an underscore. For example, `name` or `_score` are valid, but `1age` is not.

Second, it cannot contain spaces. `student_name` is valid, but `student name` with a space is not.

Third, you cannot use reserved keywords, such as `if` or `while`.

Fourth, variable names are case-sensitive. `age` and `Age` are different variables.

Multiple Variables Example

For example, if `name` equals "Arun", `age` equals eighteen, and `city` equals "Coimbatore".

We can then print: "My name is", comma `name`, which would output: "My name is Arun".
Then `print`: "I am", comma `age`, comma "years old", which would output: "I am eighteen years old".
And `print`: "I live in", comma `city`, which would output: "I live in Coimbatore".

Using a formatted string, also known as an f-string, you could `print` (f-quote, "My name is", open curly brace, `name`, close curly brace, "and I am", open curly brace, `age`, close curly brace, "years old.", close quote, close parenthesis). This is called an f-string.

Dynamic Typing in Python

Python is dynamically typed. For example, you can set `x` to ten, and then later, set `x` to "Hello" in quotes. Python allows changing the data type of a variable. You do not need to declare data types like in some other languages.

Mini Practice Activity

Try this small activity: Create three variables: `student_name`, `student_age`, and `is_present`. Then print them in one sentence.

For example, if `student_name` is "Ravi", `student_age` is fifteen, and `is_present` is True, you could print an f-string like this: open f-quote, open curly brace, `student_name`, close curly brace, "is", open curly brace, `student_age`, close curly brace, "years old. Present status:", open curly brace, `is_present`, close curly brace, close quote, close parenthesis.

Summary

Today we learned what programming is, what Python is, why Python is popular, how to write your first Python program, what variables are, variable naming rules, dynamic typing in Python, and how to use formatted strings.

In the next lesson, we will explore data types in detail.
