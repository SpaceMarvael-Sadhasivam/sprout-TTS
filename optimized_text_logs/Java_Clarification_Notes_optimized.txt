This document is designed as a comprehensive knowledge base, providing clarification for A.I.-driven Java doubt resolution.

## 1. Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle.

Key Characteristics include: It is Platform Independent, often summarized as "Write Once, Run Anywhere"; Object-Oriented; Secure and Robust; Multithreaded; and features Automatic Memory Management.

The Java Program Execution Flow is as follows: First, Source Code, which are dot Java files. Second, this is compiled by `javac` into Bytecode, or dot class files. And third, the Bytecode is executed by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM.

The JDK refers to the Java Development Kit. The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment. And the JVM executes bytecode.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Introduction)**

For Critical Thinking: Why does Java use a virtual machine instead of compiling directly to machine code?
For Creativity: Modify a Hello World program to print three personalized messages.
For Communication: Explain the Java Development Kit, Java Runtime Environment, and Java Virtual Machine using a real-world analogy.
For Collaboration: One student draws the execution flow, while another explains it.

## 2. Variables and Data Types

Java is strongly typed. Every variable must declare its data type before usage.

The syntax is: `datatype variableName = value;`

For example: an integer `age` set to twenty-five; a double `salary` set to fifty-thousand point seventy-five; a character `grade` set to capital A; and a boolean `isActive` set to `true`.

Variable Types include: Local Variables, Instance Variables, and Static Variables.

Scope determines where a variable can be accessed.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Variables)**

For Critical Thinking: What error occurs if a variable is used without initialization?
For Creativity: Create a student profile program using five variables.
For Communication: Explain variable scope with an example.
For Collaboration: One person writes variables, and another predicts the output.

## 3. Primitive Data Types

Java has eight primitive types:

*   Byte, which uses one byte for small integers.
*   Short, using two bytes for medium integers.
*   Int, using four bytes for the most common integer type.
*   Long, using eight bytes for very large integers, which requires an L suffix.
*   Float, using four bytes for decimals, requiring an F suffix.
*   Double, using eight bytes for high precision decimals.
*   Char, using two bytes for a single character, with Unicode supported.
*   And Boolean, for true or false values.

Here are some examples: an integer `number` set to ten; a long `population` set to eight billion L; a float `price` set to nineteen point ninety-nine F; a double `pi` set to three point one four one five nine; a character `grade` set to capital A; and a boolean `passed` set to `true`.

Regarding Memory Allocation: Primitive types store actual values directly in memory.

### Type Casting in Detail

First, Widening, also known as Implicit Casting: A smaller type automatically converts to a larger type. For example: an integer `x` set to ten, and a double `y` set to `x`.

Next, Narrowing, or Explicit Casting: A larger type is converted to a smaller type manually. For example: a double `value` set to nine point seven, and an integer `result` cast from `value`.

Note that narrowing may cause data loss.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Primitive Types)**

For Critical Thinking: Why is double preferred over float in financial calculations?
For Creativity: Design a temperature converter using type casting.
For Communication: Explain narrowing casting with a real-world example.
For Collaboration: One person writes casting code, and another checks for edge cases.

## 4. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive types store references to memory locations.

Examples include: Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interfaces, and Objects.

As a String example: a String `name` is set to 'Java'.

For an Arrays example: an integer array `numbers` is set to one, two, three, four.

The key difference is: Primitive types offer direct value storage, while non-primitive types offer memory reference storage.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Non-Primitive Types)**

For Critical Thinking: Why are Strings immutable in Java?
For Creativity: Create an array of marks and calculate the average.
For Communication: Explain reference versus value using an analogy.
For Collaboration: One person declares an array, and another writes a loop to print it.

## 5. Operators in Java

Arithmetic Operators include plus, minus, multiply, divide, and modulo.

Relational Operators are 'is equal to', 'is not equal to', 'greater than', 'less than', 'greater than or equal to', and 'less than or equal to'.

Logical Operators are 'AND', 'OR', and 'NOT'.

Assignment Operators are 'equals', 'plus equals', 'minus equals', 'multiply equals', 'divide equals', and 'modulo equals'.

Unary Operators are 'increment' and 'decrement'.

The Ternary Operator follows the pattern: condition question mark value one colon value two.

Here's an example: Let `a` be an integer set to ten. Let `b` be an integer set to five. System dot out dot print line, `a` plus `b`.

A common mistake is: Using a single equals sign instead of a double equals sign inside conditions.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Operators)**

For Critical Thinking: What logical error occurs if operator precedence is misunderstood?
For Creativity: Build a calculator supporting all arithmetic operators.
For Communication: Explain 'AND' versus 'OR' using a traffic rules example.
For Collaboration: One person writes a condition, and another tests multiple inputs.

## 6. Control Flow Statements

If, if-else, nested if, and switch statements control decision making.

For example: If `age` is greater than or equal to eighteen, print 'Adult'. Else, print 'Minor'.

Here's a Switch example: Switch on `day`. If case one, print 'Monday' and break. For the default case, print 'Invalid'.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Control Flow)**

For Critical Thinking: Why is `break` necessary in switch statements?
For Creativity: Create a grading system using if-else.
For Communication: Compare switch and if-else logically.
For Collaboration: Convert a switch statement to an if-else statement.

## 7. Loops

Loops repeat a block of code.

The `for` Loop: For `int i` equals zero, while `i` is less than five, increment `i`. Print `i`.

The `while` Loop: Initialize `i` to zero. While `i` is less than five, print `i` and then increment `i`.

A `do-while` loop executes at least once.

The `break` statement stops loop execution.

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Loops)**

For Critical Thinking: What causes infinite loops?
For Creativity: Generate a multiplication table using a loop.
For Communication: Explain the difference between `while` and `do-while` loops.
For Collaboration: One person writes a loop, and another inserts `break` logic.

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

A Class is a blueprint.
An Object is an instance of a class.
A Constructor initializes an object.
Encapsulation is data hiding using private variables.
Inheritance is when one class inherits another.
Polymorphism refers to the same method having different behavior.
And Abstraction is hiding internal implementation.

For example: A class named 'Student' can contain a String `name` and an integer `age`.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (OOP)**

For Critical Thinking: Why is encapsulation important for security?
For Creativity: Design a Bank Account class.
For Communication: Explain inheritance using a family example.
For Collaboration: One person writes a class, and another creates an object.

## 9. Exception Handling

Exceptions are runtime errors.

Here's an example: Within a `try` block, if we attempt to set integer `a` to ten divided by zero, a `catch` block will handle the exception, printing 'Error occurred'. A `finally` block will then execute, printing 'Program ended'.

Types of exceptions include: Checked Exceptions and Unchecked Exceptions.

**A.I. Tutor: Four C Questions (Exceptions)**

For Critical Thinking: Why is exception handling necessary in production systems?
For Creativity: Handle user input errors.
For Communication: Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
For Collaboration: One person creates an exception, and another handles it.
