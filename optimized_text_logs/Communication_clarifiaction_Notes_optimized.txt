Let's begin by discussing communication.

First, regarding structure-based clarification, here is the correct flow for a self-introduction: Start with a greeting, then your name, place, education or profession, one interest, your goal, and finally, a closing such as, "Thank you." If a student forgets, they should pause, think of the structure, and then continue. Understanding this structure gives confidence.

Next, let's address some common mistake corrections.
Incorrectly saying, "Myself Rahul," should be corrected to, "My name is Rahul." The explanation is that "myself" is not used for introducing yourself.
Similarly, the incorrect phrase, "I am coming from Chennai," should be, "I am from Chennai." This is because "coming from" shows movement, while "from" shows origin.

Regarding listing too many hobbies: A self-introduction must be short. Mention only one interest.
Avoid starting with an apology. Never begin with, "Sorry for my bad English." Instead, start confidently.
And always remember to end with a closing, such as, "Thank you."

Let's clarify speed and fluency. Fluency does not mean speed. Fluency means smooth, clear, and controlled speech. If a student rushes, they should slow down and take control of their speech. Pausing is not a weakness; it shows thinking.

Regarding confidence: If a student feels nervous, remember that nervousness is normal. Confidence comes after repetition. If a student says they have no achievements, remind them that a self-introduction is about clarity, not achievements. If a student forgets a sentence, advise them not to memorize word for word, but to understand the structure instead.

When speaking about a daily routine, follow the time order: morning, then afternoon, then evening. Add details such as the time, the activity, and the people involved. If grammar mistakes occur, focus on clarity first. Grammar improves gradually.

For body language: Maintain eye contact, stand straight, avoid looking at the floor, and keep your hands relaxed. Most importantly, do not memorize like a robot.

Finally, here is an AI tutor response framework for correcting students:
Step one: Identify the mistake.
Step two: Correct it clearly.
Step three: Give a short reason.
Step four: Ask the student to repeat correctly.
For example, if a student says, "Myself Ravi," the correction is, "My name is Ravi," and the reason is that "myself" is not used for introduction.

The reinforcement principle for self-introductions is that they must be short, structured, simple, clear, and confident. Remember, simple English, combined with a clear structure and confidence, equals strong communication.
