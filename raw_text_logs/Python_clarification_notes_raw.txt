Chapter 1
1.1. Python Basics
Why Python?
• Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming
languages.
• Python is versatile: used in web development, data science, AI,
automation, and more.
• Huge community and lots of libraries to help you build almost anything.
1.2. Variables
A variable is like a box with a name.
• You put something inside the box (a number or word).
• The name on the box helps you find what’s inside later.
Variable Naming Rules:
1. Start with a letter or underscore (_)
Example: name, _score
2. Not allowed: 1age (can’t start with a number) Can
contain letters, numbers, and underscores Example:
age1, student_name
3. No spaces allowed
Use underscore _ instead of space
Example: first_name (correct), first name (wrong)
4. Cannot use Python reserved keywords
Words like if, for, while, class cannot be variable names
5. Variable names are case-sensitive
Age and age are different variables
6. Keep names meaningful
Use names that describe what the variable holds, like score or student_age
Example:
name = "Sprout" student
= 900
• name box holds "Sprout".
• student box holds 900.
You can use the box’s name to get the
value: print ("Hello, " + name)
Output:
Hello, Sprout
How to Initialize a Variable Using Assignment Operator
• Choose a variable name
• Use the assignment operator = to give it a value.
Syntax: Variable_name
= value Example:
name = "Sprout"
location = “Coimbatore”
age = 6
Explanation:
• Stores the word "Sprout" in the variable name • Stores the
word "Coimbatore" in the variable location • Stores number
6 in the variable age

Thinking observe.
Creativity Create a profile card with name, age, and favorite color using
variables.
Communication Explain to a friend why variable names shouldn't start with a number.
Collaboration Work with a peer: one writes code for name and age, another adds
hobbies.
1.3. Data Types
What Are Data Types?
• When we create a variable, Python needs to know what kind of value is stored
inside.
• That “kind” is called a data type.
Imagine a school bag:
• If you put books in it → it becomes a book bag.
• If you put snacks → it becomes a lunch bag.
In Python, the type of value decides the data type of the variable.
Data Type Description Example
int Whole numbers 5, -10, 0
float Decimal numbers 3.14, -0.5
bool True/False values True, False
str Text (string) data "Hello", '123'
Syntax:
variable_name = value
1.3.1. Integer (int)
What is an Integer?
An integer is a whole number, no decimals. It
can be:
• Positive → 5, 100
• Negative → -7, -22
• Zero → 0
Syntax
variable_name = integer_value
Example Program
age = 5
year = 2020
print("Age:", age)
print("Year:", year)
Explanation
• age = 5 → We’re storing a whole number in the variable age. That’s an
integer.
• year = 2020 → Years are whole numbers, so again this is int.
We use print() to display them.

Critical Why would using a float instead of an integer cause issues
Thinking when you're counting people in a classroom?
Creativity Design a small student info card using integers like
roll_number, age, and grade. Print the values and share
it.
Communication If a user enters their age as a float (e.g., 10.5), how would you
explain to them why the system needs an
integer?
Collaboration Work with a friend to create a program that accepts a
student’s roll number and age, then prints a welcome
message.
1.3.2. Float (Decimal Numbers)
What is a Float?
A float is a number that has a decimal point.
Examples: 3.14, 0.5, -7.25
We use floats when we need precision , like in money, temperature, or measurements.
Syntax
variable_name = decimal_value
Example Program
price = 49.99
temperature = -2.5
height = 5.8
print("Price:", price)
print("Temperature:", temperature)
print("Height:", height) Explanation
• price = 49.99 → This is a float because it has a decimal. Useful when
dealing with money.
• temperature = -2.5 → Even though it’s negative, it’s still a float because of
the decimal point.
• height = 5.8 → Height is often measured in points or inches, so float
makes sense.

price.
Communication Explain to someone new to
programming why 3.0 and 3 are
stored differently in memory.
Collaboration Pair up and create a weather report
generator that stores today's
temperature, humidity, and wind
speed using floats.
1.3.3. Boolean (True or False)
What is a Boolean?
A Boolean is a special data type that has only two possible values:
• True
• False
We use it for decisions, like:
• Is a student present?
• Has the user logged in?
• Is the number greater than 10?
Syntax variable_name
= True or
variable_name = False
Example Program
is_logged_in = True
is_holiday = False
passed_exam = True
print("User logged in:", is_logged_in) print("Is
today a holiday?", is_holiday) print("Passed the
exam:", passed_exam) Explanation
• is_logged_in = True → The user has logged in, so it’s True. • is_holiday =
False → Today is not a holiday, so we mark it as False. • passed_exam =
True → This student passed, so we store it as True.

1.4. Strings
What is a String?
• A string is simply a sequence of characters — like words or sentences inside
quotes. It can contain letters, numbers, and symbols.
• You can think of a string like a sentence written on a ribbon — each character has a
place (called an index), and you can pull characters out or change them around.
Creating a String
Syntax:
text = "sprout"
or
text = ' Brighter tomorrow'
Example:
greeting = "Welcome to sprout" print(greeting)
Output:
Welcome to sprout
Explanation:
• The variable greeting stores a message (string).
• print() displays it.
String Indexing
Each character in a string has a position number (index), starting from
0. Example:
word = "Sprout" print(word[0])
//First letter print(word[5])
//Last letter
Output:
S
t
Explanation:
• word[0] gives the first character.
• word[5] gives the sixth character (index starts from 0).
String Slicing
You can cut out parts of a string using slicing.
Syntax:
string[start:end]
Example:
msg = "HelloSprout" print(msg[0:5])
# From index 0 to 4 Output:
Hello
Explanation:
• Starts from index 0 and goes up to (but not including) index 5.
Common String Methods
Python gives many built-in methods to work with strings.
Method Description
lower() Converts to lowercase
upper() Converts to uppercase
strip() Removes spaces at ends
replace() Replaces part of the string
split() Breaks string into a list
find() Finds the index of a character
len() Returns length of string
Example Program Using String Methods
name = " Python Programming "
1. print(name.strip()) //Removes spaces
2. print(name.lower()) //Lowercase
3. print(name.upper()) //Uppercase
4. print(name.replace("Python", "Java")) //Replace word 5. print(len(name)) // Count
characters including spaces Output:
1. Python Programming
2. python programming
3. PYTHON PROGRAMMING
4. Java Programming
5. 24
f-Strings (Formatted Strings)
Used to combine variables with strings in a neat way.
Example:
name = "Sprout"
age = 5
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
Output:
My name is sprout and I am 5 years old.
Explanation:
• The f before the string lets you place variables inside curly braces {}.

1.5. Operators
Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. • Think
of them as action signs like + for addition or == for checking if two things are
equal.
Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
Used for basic math operations:
• + Addition
• Subtraction
• Multiplication
• / Division
• % Modulus (remainder)
• ** Exponent (power)
• // Floor division (division rounded down)
Syntax
• a + b # adds two numbers
• a - b # subtracts b from a
• a * b # multiplies a and b
• a / b # divides a by b (result can be decimal)
• a % b # gives remainder when a is divided by b
• a ** b # raises a to the power of b
• a // b # divides a by b and gives the whole number part only
Example programs
x = 15
y = 4
Output = 19
Explanation:
• Think of addition as putting two numbers together. Here, 15 plus 4
makes 19. So, addition holds 19.
• subtraction means you take one number away from another. 15 minus 4
leaves 11, so subtraction is 11.
• multiplication is like adding a number many times. 15 times 4 is 60, so
multiplication stores 60.
• division is splitting a number into equal parts. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75 —
not a whole number, so you get a decimal.
• modulus gives the leftover after dividing. When 15 is divided by 4, the
leftover (remainder) is 3. So modulus is 3.
• exponent means power — raising a number to another’s power. 15 to the
power of 4 (15⁴) is 50625, so exponent holds 50625.
• floor_division divides and keeps only the whole number part, ignoring
decimals. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, but floor division gives 3.
2. Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values and return True or False:
• == Equal to
• != Not equal to
• Greater than
• < Less than
• >= Greater than or equal to
• <= Less than or equal to
Syntax:
• a == b # checks if a is equal to b
• a != b # checks if a is not equal to b
• a > b # checks if a is greater than b
• a < b # checks if a is less than b
• a >= b # checks if a is greater than or equal to b
• a <= b # checks if a is less than or equal to b
Example program:
x = 10
y = 20
• equal = (x == y)
• not_equal = (x != y)
• greater = (x > y)
• less = (x < y)
• greater_equal = (x >= y)
• less_equal = (x <= y)
Explanation:
• equal checks if 10 is the same as 20. Since they are different, it is False. •
not_equal checks if 10 is different from 20. Since they are different, it is True.
• greater checks if 10 is bigger than 20. It’s not, so it is False. •
less checks if 10 is smaller than 20. It is, so it is True.
• greater_equal checks if 10 is bigger or the same as 20. It’s not, so False. • less_equal
checks if 10 is smaller or the same as 20. Since 10 is smaller, it is True.
3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements:
• and Both conditions True
• or At least one condition True
• not Reverses the result
Syntax:
• a and b → True if both a and b are True
• a or b →True if either a or b is True
• not a →True if a is False, and False if a is True (it reverses)
Example:
x = True
y = False
• and_result = x and y
• or_result = x or y
• not_result = not x
Explanation:
• and_result asks: "Are both x and y True?"
Here, x is True but y is False, so the answer is False because both must be True
for and to be True.
• or_result asks: "Is either x or y True?"
Since x is True, it doesn’t matter what y is — or says True if any one is True.
• not_result flips the value of x.
Since x is True, not x becomes False. It’s like saying “not True” = False.
4. Assignment Operators
Used to assign or update values:
➢ = Simple assignment
➢ += Add and assign
➢ -= Subtract and assign
➢ *= Multiply and assign
➢ /= Divide and assign
➢ %= Modulus and assign
Syntax:
• a = b →Assign value of b to a
• a += b → Add b to a, then assign result to a (a = a + b)
• a -= b → Subtract b from a, then assign to a (a = a - b) • a
*= b →Multiply a by b, then assign to a (a = a * b)
• a /= b →Divide a by b, then assign to a (a = a / b)
• a %= b →Take modulus of a by b, then assign to a (a = a % b) • a
**= b → Raise a to power b, then assign to a (a = a ** b) • a //= b →
Floor divide a by b, then assign to a (a = a // b) Example program a = 10
• a += 5
Now a becomes 10 + 5 = 15
• a -= 3
Now a becomes 15 - 3 = 12
• a *= 2
Now a becomes 12 * 2 = 24
• a /= 4
Now a becomes 24 / 4 = 6.0
• a %= 4
Now a becomes 6.0 % 4 = 2.0
Explanation:
• a = 10 means we start by giving the value 10 to variable a. • a += 5 means
“add 5 to a” and update a with this new value, so a becomes 15.
• a -= 3 means “subtract 3 from a” and update a, so now a is 12. • a *= 2
means “multiply a by 2” and update a to 24.
• a /= 4 means “divide a by 4” and update a to 6.0 (notice it becomes a
float).
• a %= 4 means “get the remainder when a is divided by 4” and update a to
2.0.
Identity Operators
Check if two variables point to the same object:
o is Returns True if same object
o is not Returns True if not the same object
Syntax:
• a is b
True if a and b refer to the same object
• a is not b
True if a and b do NOT refer to the same object
Example program:
x = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]
y = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]
z = x
print(x is y): False
print(x is z): True
print(x is not y): True
Explanation:
• x and y have the same contents, but they are different objects in memory, so x is
y is False.
• z is assigned to x, so both z and x point to the same object, making x is z True.
• Since x and y are not the same object, x is not y is True.
5. Membership Operators
Check if a value is present in a sequence (like a list or string): o in
Returns True if present
o not in Returns True if not present
Syntax:
➢ item in sequence
True if item is found inside the sequence
➢ item not in sequence
True if item is NOT found inside the sequence
Example program:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
• print("banana" in fruits)
Answer: True
• print("mango" in fruits)
Answer: False
• print("grape" not in fruits)
Answer: True
Explanation:
• "banana" in fruits checks if "banana" is inside the list fruits. Since it is, the
answer is True.
• "mango" in fruits asks if "mango" is in the list. It’s not there, so the answer
is False.
• "grape" not in fruits asks if "grape" is NOT in the list. Because it’s not
present, this is True.

1.6. Control Flow
Control flow helps your program decide which code to run based on
conditions. It’s like making choices!
1.6.1. if-else Statement
Syntax
if condition:
code to run if condition is True else:
code to run if condition is False
Example program:
age = 18
if age >= 18:
print("You are eligible to vote.") else:
print("You eligible not to vote.")
Explanation:
• The program checks if age is 18 or more.
• If True, it prints “You are eligible to vote.”
• If False, it prints “You eligible not to vote.”

1.6.2. Nested if Statement
You can put an if statement inside another if. This is called nested if.
Syntax:
if condition1:
if condition2:
//code if both conditions are True
Example program:
age = 20 is_registered
= True if age >= 18:
if is_registered:
print("You are eligible to vote.") else:
print("You need to register to vote.") else:
print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
Explanation:
• First, it checks if the person is 18 or older (voting age).
• If yes, it then checks if they are registered to vote.
• If registered, it prints “You are eligible to vote.”
• If not registered, it reminds them to register.
• If under 18, it says they are not eligible yet.

1.6.3. Ternary Operator (Short if-else)
When you want a quick decision in one line, use the ternary operator.
Syntax:
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
Example program:
age = 16
message = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(message)
Explanation:
• It checks if age is 18 or more.
• If yes, message becomes "Adult".
• If no, message becomes "Minor".
• Then it prints the message.
AI Tutor Questions:

Thinking
Creativity Create a ternary check that returns "Pass" or "Fail" based on
marks.
Communication Convert a ternary into normal if-else and explain both versions.
Collaboration One writes the ternary version, the other writes the regular
version. Compare.
1.7. Loops
Loops help you repeat a block of code again, either a specific number of times or until a
condition is met.
while Loop
Use a while loop when you don’t know exactly how many times to repeat
just keep going as long as the condition is True.
Syntax:
while condition:
//code to repeat
Example:
count = 1
while count <= 5:
print("Count is:", count)
count += 1 Explanation:
• Start with count = 1.
• The loop checks: Is count less than or equal to 5?
• If yes, it prints the value and increases count by 1.
• This repeats until count becomes 6, then it stops.

for Loop
Use a for loop when you know how many times you want to repeat — often with a
list or range of numbers.
Syntax:
for variable in sequence:
//code to repeat
Example program:
for i in range(1, 6):
print("Number:", i)
Explanation:
• range(1, 6) gives numbers from 1 to 5.
• Each time, i takes the next number.
• It prints i from 1 to 5.

Creativity Make a countdown from 10 to 1 using a for loop.
Communication Teach a friend how range(start, stop) works with an example.
Collaboration One writes a loop printing even numbers; the other handles odd
numbers.
break Statement
break is used to stop a loop early when a condition is met.
Example:
for i in range(1, 10):
if i == 5:
break
print(i)
Explanation:
• This loop prints numbers from 1.
• But when i becomes 5, break stops the loop.
• Output: 1, 2, 3, 4
continue Statement
continue is used to skip the current loop step and move to the next one.
Example:
for i in range(1, 6):
if i == 3:
continue print(i)
Explanation:
• This prints numbers from 1 to 5.
• But when i is 3, it skips printing and goes to the next.
• Output: 1, 2, 4, 5 (3 is skipped)

else with Loops
You can use else after a loop — it runs only if the loop completes normally (not
stopped by break).
Example:
for i in range(1, 4):
print("Checking:", i)
else:
print("Loop completed.")
Explanation:
• It prints numbers 1 to 3.
• Then, since the loop finished without a break, the else runs. •
Output ends with “Loop completed.”

1.8. Functions
• Functions are like mini programs inside your program.
• You write the code once, give it a name, and then reuse it anytime by
"calling" it.
def and return Syntax:
def function_name():
# code inside the function
return result
Example:
def greet():
return "Hello, sprout"
message = greet()
print(message)
Explanation:
• def greet(): creates a function named greet.
• return "Hello, welcome!" sends back a message when the function is called.
• greet() is called and the result is stored in message.
• Then we print it.
AI tutor question:

Function with Parameters
You can pass values (called parameters) into a function.
Syntax:
def greet(name):
print("Hello,", name)
Example:
def greet(name):
print("Hello,", name)
greet("sprout")
Explanation:
• The function expects a value called name.
• When you call greet("sprout"), it prints: Hello, sprout

Creativity Design a make_card(name, age) function that prints a greeting
card message.
Communication Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument to

Collaboration One partner writes a function with two parameters, the other
tests it with various values.
*args – Variable Number of Arguments Use
*args to send a list of values to a function. Syntax:
def add_numbers(*args):
# args behaves like a tuple
Example:
def add_numbers(*args):
total = 0
for num in args:
total += num return
total
print(add_numbers(10, 20, 30))
Explanation:
• *args allows the function to accept any number of values. •
It adds 10 + 20 + 30 and returns 60.
**kwargs – Keyword Arguments
Use **kwargs to pass values with names (keys).
Example:
def print_info(**kwargs):
for key, value in kwargs.items():
print(key, ":", value)
print_info(name="Sprout", age=6)
Explanation:
• **kwargs lets you pass data like a dictionary (key: value). • Here,
name="Sprout" and age=6 are passed to the function. • The function
prints each key-value pair.
AI Tutor Question:
 Q1: How does using *args help when you don’t know
how many arguments you’ll need?
 Follow-up: Can you create a function that takes in any
number of scores and returns their average?
 Q2: Collaborate on writing a flexible report generator
using **kwargs. Try different inputs and discuss.

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Why would using *args or **kwargs be better than fixed
Thinking parameters in some cases? Give an example.
Creativity Create a log_event function that uses **kwargs to log events with
keys like user, time, and action.
Communication Explain to a friend the difference between *args and **kwargs
using your own analogy.
Collaboration One student writes a function using *args, another adds **kwargs
and they combine use cases.
Lambda Functions (Short One-Line Functions)
Use lambda when you want a small, one-time function.
Syntax:
lambda arguments: expression
Example:
square = lambda x: x * x
print(square(5)) Explanation:
• lambda x: x * x creates a small function to square a number. •
square(5) returns 25.

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Compare a regular function with
Thinking a lambda function. When should
you use each one?
Creativity Create a lambda function that
takes a number and returns
"Even" or "Odd".
Communication Teach your partner how to
convert a normal function into a
lambda function using a simple
example.
Collaboration One student writes a lambda to
sort a list of names; the other
provides test cases.
Variable Scope (Local and Global)
Variables inside functions are local — they can’t be used outside.
Example:
def my_func():
x = 10
print("Inside:", x)
my_func()
print("Outside:", x) //This will cause an error
Explanation:
• x = 10 is created inside the function.
• When you try to use it outside, Python gives an error. •
It means variables have a scope (area of life).

Critical Why might using too
Thinking many global
variables lead to
errors in a big
program? Give an
example.
Creativity Write a small game
setup function where
a local variable holds
the player's name and
prints it.
Communication Explain to a friend
how local and global
variables differ. Use
your
own example.
Collaboration One student writes a
global variable; the
other writes a
function to modify it
using global
keyword.
