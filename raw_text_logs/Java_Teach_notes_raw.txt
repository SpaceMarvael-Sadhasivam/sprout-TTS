Data Types in Java
Introduction
Before we write programs in Java, we must understand something very important.
What type of data are we storing?
In programming, data types define:
 What kind of value a variable can store
 How much memory it uses
 What operations can be performed
Java is a strongly typed language.
That means:
You must declare the data type before using a variable.
Unlike Python, Java does not guess the type automatically.
What is a Data Type?
A data type tells the computer:
“What type of value am I storing?”
For example:
 10 → integer
 3.14 → decimal
 'A' → character
 true → boolean
 "Hello" → string
In Java, we must clearly specify it.
Example:
int age = 20;
Here:
 int → data type
 age → variable name
 20 → value
Types of Data Types in Java
Java has two main categories:
1️.Primitive Data Types
2️.Non-Primitive Data Types
Primitive → stores actual value
Non-Primitive → stores reference (memory address)
Now let us understand primitive types first.
Primitive Data Types
Java has 8 primitive data types.
Let us learn them one by one.
byte
 Used to store small whole numbers
 Size: 1 byte
 Range: -128 to 127
Example:
byte number = 100;
Used when memory saving is important.
short
 Slightly larger than byte
 Size: 2 bytes
short value = 10000;
int (Most Common)
 Used for whole numbers
 Size: 4 bytes
 Most commonly used integer type
int age = 25;
Usually we use int for normal numbers.
long
 Used for very large numbers
 Size: 8 bytes
long population = 8000000000L;
Notice:
We add L at the end.
float
 Used for decimal numbers
 Size: 4 bytes
float price = 99.99f;
Important:
We must add f at the end.
double (Most Common for Decimals)
 Used for decimal numbers
 Size: 8 bytes
 More precise than float
double salary = 45678.89;
Most developers prefer double.
char
 Stores a single character
 Uses single quotes
 Size: 2 bytes
char grade = 'A';
Important:
Only one character allowed.
boolean
 Stores true or false
 Used for conditions
boolean isActive = true;
Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive types include:
 String
 Arrays
 Classes
 Objects
Example:
String name = "Rakshitha";
Important:
Primitive types store actual value.
Non-primitive types store memory reference.
Type Casting
Sometimes we convert one data type to another.
There are two types:
Widening (Automatic)
Small type → Bigger type
int x = 10;
double y = x;
No data loss.
Narrowing (Manual)
Bigger type → Smaller type
double a = 10.5;
int b = (int) a;
Decimal part is removed.
Mini Practice Activity
Create a Java program with:
 int age
 double height
 char grade
 boolean isStudent
 String name
Print all values.
Example:
int age = 20;
double height = 5.8;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isStudent = true;
String name = "Ravi";
System.out.println("Name: " + name);
System.out.println("Age: " + age);
System.out.println("Height: " + height);
System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
System.out.println("Student: " + isStudent);
Summary :
Today we learned:
 What is a data type
 Java is strongly typed
 8 primitive data types
 Non-primitive types
 Type casting
Now you understand how Java stores data internally.
In the next lesson, we will learn about operators in Java.
