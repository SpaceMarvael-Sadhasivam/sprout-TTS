Lesson: What is Python & Variables in Python
Introduction
Hello everyone.
Welcome to Kairos AI Learning.
Today we are going to start our Python journey.
In this session, we will understand:
- What is Python?
- Why is Python important?
- What are variables in Python?
Let’s begin.
What is Programming?
Before learning Python, we must understand something important.
What is programming?
Programming means giving instructions to a computer so it can perform tasks.
For example:
- Display a message
- Calculate total marks
- Store student details
- Build a website
- Create a chatbot
A computer does not understand human language.
It understands instructions written in a programming language.
That language acts as a bridge between humans and computers.
Python is one such language.
What is Python?
Python is a high-level programming language.
High-level means it is easy for humans to read and understand.
Python was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.
Why is Python popular?
- Simple and readable syntax
- Requires fewer lines of code
- Huge global community
- Used in modern technologies
Python is used in:
- Web development
- Artificial Intelligence
- Machine Learning
- Data Science
- Automation
- Game development
When you learn Python, you are learning a powerful industry-level skill.
Your First Python Program
Let us write our first Python program:
print("Hello World")
Explanation:
- print() is a built-in function.
- "Hello World" is a string.
- Quotes are used to represent text.
Output:
Hello World
If we write:
print(10)
It prints the number 10.
Important:
Text requires quotes.
Numbers do not require quotes.
What is a Variable?
A variable is a container used to store data.
Think of it like a labeled box.
Example:
age = 20
Here:
- age is the variable name.
- = is the assignment operator.
- 20 is the value stored.
Now we can use it:
print(age)
Output:
20
Variable Naming Rules
Important rules:
1. Must start with a letter or underscore.
✔ name
✔ _score
✘ 1age
2. Cannot contain spaces.
✔ student_name
✘ student name
3. Cannot use reserved keywords.
✘ if
✘ while
4. Variable names are case-sensitive.
age and Age are different variables.
Multiple Variables Example
Example:
name = "Arun"
age = 18
city = "Coimbatore"
print("My name is", name)
print("I am", age, "years old")
print("I live in", city)
Using formatted string:
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
This is called an f-string.
Dynamic Typing in Python
Python is dynamically typed.
Example:
x = 10
x = "Hello"
Python allows changing the data type of a variable.
You do not need to declare data types like in some other languages.
Mini Practice Activity
Try this small activity:
Create three variables:
- student_name
- student_age
- is_present
Then print them in one sentence.
Example:
student_name = "Ravi"
student_age = 15
is_present = True
print(f"{student_name} is {student_age} years old. Present status: {is_present}")
Summary
Today we learned:
- What programming is
- What Python is
- Why Python is popular
- How to write your first Python program
- What variables are
- Variable naming rules
- Dynamic typing in Python
- Using formatted strings
In the next lesson, we will explore data types in detail.
