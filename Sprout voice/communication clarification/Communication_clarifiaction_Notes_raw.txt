Communication
1. Structure-Based Clarification
Correct Flow of Self-Introduction:
Greeting
Name
Place
Education / Profession
One Interest
Goal
Closing (Thank you)
If a student forgets:
Pause. Think of the structure. Continue.
Structure gives confidence.
2. Common Mistake Corrections
Incorrect: “Myself Rahul.”
Correct: “My name is Rahul.”
Explanation: “Myself” is not used for introducing yourself.
Incorrect: “I am coming from Chennai.”
Correct: “I am from Chennai.”
Explanation: “Coming from” shows movement. “From” shows origin.
Listing Too Many Hobbies:
Self-introduction must be short.
Mention only one interest.
Starting With Apology:
Never begin with “Sorry for my bad English.”
Start confidently.
Ending Without Closing:
Always end with “Thank you.”
3. Speed & Fluency Clarification
Fluency does not mean speed.
Fluency = Smooth + Clear + Controlled.
If student rushes:
Slow down. Take control of your speech.
Pausing is not weakness.
Pausing shows thinking.
4. Confidence Clarification
If student feels nervous:
Nervousness is normal.
Confidence comes after repetition.
If student says they have no achievements:
Self-introduction is about clarity, not achievements.
If student forgets sentence:
Do not memorize word by word.
Understand the structure.
5. Daily Routine Speaking Clarification
Follow time order:
Morning → Afternoon → Evening
Add details:
Time
Activity
People involved
If grammar mistakes occur:
Focus on clarity first.
Grammar improves gradually.
6. Body Language Clarification
Maintain eye contact.
Stand straight.
Avoid looking at the floor.
Keep hands relaxed.
Do not memorize like a robot.
7. AI Tutor Response Framework
When correcting students:
Step 1 – Identify mistake.
Step 2 – Correct clearly.
Step 3 – Give short reason.
Step 4 – Ask student to repeat correctly.
Example:
Student: “Myself Ravi.”
Correction: “My name is Ravi.”
Reason: “Myself” is not used for introduction.
Reinforcement Principle:
Self-Introduction must be:
Short
Structured
Simple
Clear
Confident
Simple English + Clear Structure + Confidence = Strong Communication.
