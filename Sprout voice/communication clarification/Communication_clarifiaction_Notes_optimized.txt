Communication.

First, let's discuss structure-based clarification.
Here's the correct flow for a self-introduction:
Start with a greeting, then state your name, your place of origin, your education or profession, one interest, your goal, and finally, a closing, such as "Thank you."

If you find yourself forgetting, pause. Think of the structure, then continue. Structure gives confidence.

Next, let's address some common mistake corrections.
Incorrect: "Myself Rahul."
Correct: "My name is Rahul."
The explanation is: "Myself" is not used for introducing yourself.

Incorrect: "I am coming from Chennai."
Correct: "I am from Chennai."
Explanation: "Coming from" shows movement, while "from" shows origin.

Regarding listing too many hobbies: A self-introduction must be short. Mention only one interest.

And starting with an apology: Never begin with, "Sorry for my bad English." Start confidently.

Finally, ending without a closing: Always end with, "Thank you."

Third, let's clarify speed and fluency.
Fluency does not mean speed. Fluency means smooth, clear, and controlled speech.
If a student rushes, slow down. Take control of your speech.
Pausing is not a weakness; pausing shows thinking.

Fourth, on to confidence.
If a student feels nervous, remember that nervousness is normal. Confidence comes after repetition.
If a student says they have no achievements: Self-introduction is about clarity, not achievements.
If a student forgets a sentence: Do not memorize word by word. Understand the structure.

Fifth, clarifying daily routine speaking.
Follow time order: Morning, then afternoon, then evening.
Add details, like the time, the activity, and the people involved.
If grammar mistakes occur, focus on clarity first. Grammar improves gradually.

Sixth, body language clarification.
Maintain eye contact. Stand straight. Avoid looking at the floor. Keep your hands relaxed. Do not memorize like a robot.

Seventh, the AI Tutor Response Framework.
When correcting students:
Step one: Identify the mistake.
Step two: Correct it clearly.
Step three: Give a short reason.
Step four: Ask the student to repeat correctly.

For example:
If a student says, "Myself Ravi."
The correction is, "My name is Ravi."
The reason: "Myself" is not used for introduction.

Reinforcement Principle: A self-introduction must be short, structured, simple, clear, and confident.
Simple English, combined with clear structure and confidence, equals strong communication.
