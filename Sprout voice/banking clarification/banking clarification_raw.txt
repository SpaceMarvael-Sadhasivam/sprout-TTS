Alphabet Series (IBPS Pattern)
IBPS PO & Clerk Level
Alphabet Series is a high-frequency topic in the Reasoning Ability section of IBPS PO and Clerk
Prelims. It tests:
● Pattern recognition
● Logical sequencing
● Positional awareness
● Speed with accuracy
Most questions are direct scoring questions if concepts are strong.
Alphabet Position Mastery
Before solving any series, strong command over letter positions is mandatory.
● A = 1
● B = 2
● C = 3
● …
● Z = 26
Reverse positions:
● Z = 1
● Y = 2
● X = 3
● …
● A = 26
Important quick references:
● EJOTY Rule → E(5), J(10), O(15), T(20), Y(25)
● Vowels positions → A(1), E(5), I(9), O(15), U(21)
Shortcut approach:
● Convert letters into numbers first.
● Identify numerical pattern.
● Convert back to letter.
This avoids guesswork.
Constant Increment / Decrement Pattern
This is the most basic and common pattern.
Letters move with a fixed gap.
Example:
A, D, G, J, ?
Positions:
1, 4, 7, 10
Gap = +3
Next:
13 → M
Similarly, decreasing pattern:
Z, X, V, T, ?
26, 24, 22, 20
Gap = –2
Key recognition tip:
If difference remains constant → it is a fixed arithmetic progression.
Increasing / Decreasing Gap Pattern
The difference between letters increases or decreases stepwise.
Example:
B, E, I, N, ?
2, 5, 9, 14
Differences:
+3, +4, +5
Next difference:
+6
14 + 6 = 20 → T
Recognition rule:
● Check if differences form sequence like +2, +3, +4
● Or –3, –4, –5
Example (decreasing):
Z, V, Q, K, ?
26, 22, 17, 11
–4, –5, –6
Next:
–7 → 4 → D
These are very common in IBPS PO.
Alternate Term Pattern
Series may consist of two interlinked sequences.
Example:
A, D, C, F, E, ?
Split into:
Odd positions:
A, C, E → +2
Even positions:
D, F → +2
Next odd:
G
Always check alternate positions if pattern looks inconsistent.
Another example:
A, Z, B, Y, C, ?
Odd:
A, B, C
Even:
Z, Y
Next even:
X
Alternate patterns are extremely common in prelims.
Reverse Alphabet Pairing
Letters move in opposite direction simultaneously.
Example:
A, X, B, W, C, ?
A → forward
X → backward
Pattern:
1, 24
2, 23
3, 22
Next:
D (4) and V (22)
These patterns often combine forward + backward logic.
Opposite Letter Mapping (A–Z Type)
Each letter has an opposite in alphabet.
Opposite formula:
Opposite position = 27 – original position
Example:
A(1) → 27 – 1 = 26 → Z
B(2) → 27 – 2 = 25 → Y
C(3) → 27 – 3 = 24 → X
Common IBPS pattern:
A, Z, B, Y, C, ?
Opposite mapping logic used.
Shortcut:
Remember pairs:
A–Z
B–Y
C–X
D–W
E–V
Square / Cube Position Pattern
Positions may follow mathematical rules.
Example:
● A (1² = 1)
● D (2² = 4)
● I (3² = 9)
● P (4² = 16)
Next:
5² = 25 → Y
Similarly, cube pattern:
A (1³ = 1)
H (2³ = 8)
27 exceeds 26 → adjust using cycle
Recognition clue:
If gaps are irregular but growing rapidly → check square/cube.
Mixed Alphanumeric Pattern
Letters and numbers move simultaneously.
Example:
A1, C3, E5, G7, ?
Letters:
+2
Numbers:
+2
Next:
I9
Advanced type:
A26, B25, C24, ?
Letter increasing
Number decreasing
Answer:
D23
These appear often in IBPS PO.
Cycle Pattern (After Z Restart)
Alphabet is circular.
After Z (26), next becomes A (1).
Example:
Y, A, C, E, ?
25, 1, 3, 5
Pattern:
+2
Next:
7 → G
Adjustment rule:
If position > 26
Subtract 26
Example:
33 – 26 = 7
This is called mod 26 logic.
Symmetrical Pattern
Series mirrors itself.
Example:
A, C, F, C, A
Pattern:
+2, +3, –3, –2
Mirror around middle term.
These are less frequent but tricky.
Word Rearrangement Logic
Letters of a word are rearranged alphabetically.
Example:
TIMER
Arrange alphabetically:
E I M R T
Questions may ask:
● What is the new position of T?
● Which letter is 3rd from right after arrangement?
Method:
1. Rearrange alphabetically.
2. Compare original vs new positions.
Alphabet Test – Position Based Questions
In word-based problems:
Example:
BANKING
Count letters between A and G.
Step 1:
Write word properly.
Step 2:
Locate positions.
Step 3:
Count letters strictly between.
Another type:
Count vowels between two consonants.
Important:
Do not include boundary letters unless asked.
Pair Counting Logic
In word “EDUCATION”
Check pairs having same gap as in alphabet.
Method:
1. Compare each adjacent pair.
2. Calculate gap.
3. Match with actual alphabet gap.
These questions require careful checking.
Advanced Recognition Strategy
When solving series:
● Step 1: Convert to numbers.
● Step 2: Write differences above letters.
● Step 3: Check alternate patterns.
● Step 4: Check reverse pattern.
● Step 5: Check mathematical patterns.
● Step 6: Check alphanumeric interaction.
Never assume a pattern after only two terms.
Common IBPS PO Traps
● Pattern changes after 3rd term.
● Alternate + increasing gap combined.
● Reverse mapping hidden inside.
● Cycle adjustment forgotten.
● Wrong counting due to panic.
Speed Improvement Tips
● Memorize alphabet positions completely.
● Practice writing A–Z mentally in 5 seconds.
● Practice reverse mapping daily.
● Solve 20 timed questions per day.
● Identify patterns within 15 seconds.
Exam Weightage Insight
In IBPS PO & Clerk Prelims:
● 3–5 questions from Alphabet Series / Alphabet Test
● Usually easy-moderate
● Highly scoring
● Time per question: 30–45 seconds
In Mains:
Appears inside puzzles or coding-decoding combinations.
