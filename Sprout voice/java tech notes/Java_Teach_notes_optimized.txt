Welcome! Before we write programs in Java, we must understand something very important: data types.

We need to ask: "What type of data are we storing?" In programming, data types define three key things: first, what kind of value a variable can store; second, how much memory it uses; and third, what operations can be performed on that data.

Java is a strongly typed language. This means you must declare the data type before using a variable. Unlike Python, Java does not guess the type automatically.

So, what exactly is a data type? A data type tells the computer: "What type of value am I storing?" For example, the number ten represents an integer. Three point one four represents a decimal. The letter 'A' represents a character. 'True' represents a boolean value. And "Hello" represents a string. In Java, we must clearly specify the type for each piece of data.

Let's look at an example: `int age = 20;` Here, 'int' is the data type, 'age' is the variable name, and '20' is the value.

Java has two main categories of data types: Primitive Data Types and Non-Primitive Data Types. Primitive types store the actual value, while non-primitive types store a reference, which is essentially a memory address. Let's understand primitive types first.

Java has eight primitive data types. Let's learn them one by one.

First, `byte`. It's used to store small whole numbers. Its size is one byte, and its range is from minus one hundred twenty-eight to one hundred twenty-seven. For example, `byte number = 100;` This type is used when memory saving is important.

Next, `short`. It's slightly larger than a byte, with a size of two bytes. An example is `short value = 10000;`

`int` is the most common integer type. It's used for whole numbers, has a size of four bytes, and is the most commonly used integer type. For instance, `int age = 25;` Usually, we use `int` for normal numbers.

`long` is used for very large numbers, with a size of eight bytes. For example, `long population = 8000000000L;` Notice that we add an uppercase 'L' at the end of the number.

`float` is used for decimal numbers, with a size of four bytes. An example is `float price = 99.99f;` It's important to remember that we must add a lowercase 'f' at the end of the number.

`double` is the most common type for decimals. It's used for decimal numbers, has a size of eight bytes, and is more precise than `float`. For example, `double salary = 45678.89;` Most developers prefer using `double`.

`char` stores a single character and uses single quotes. Its size is two bytes. For instance, `char grade = 'A';` It's important to remember that only one character is allowed.

Finally, `boolean`. It stores either `true` or `false` and is used for conditions. An example is `boolean isActive = true;`

Now let's look at Non-Primitive Data Types. These include String, Arrays, Classes, and Objects. For example, `String name = "Rakshitha";` Remember, primitive types store the actual value, while non-primitive types store a memory reference.

Sometimes we need to convert one data type to another. This is called Type Casting, and there are two types. First, **Widening**, which is automatic. This converts a small type to a bigger type. For example, if you have `int x = 10;` and then `double y = x;` there is no data loss. Second, **Narrowing**, which is manual. This converts a bigger type to a smaller type. For example, if you have `double a = 10.5;` and then `int b = (int) a;` the decimal part is removed.

Here's a mini practice activity for you: Create a Java program with variables for `int age`, `double height`, `char grade`, `boolean isStudent`, and `String name`. Then, print all these values. For example, you could write:
`int age = 20;`
`double height = 5.8;`
`char grade = 'A';`
`boolean isStudent = true;`
`String name = "Ravi";`
And then print them using:
`System.out.println("Name: " + name);`
`System.out.println("Age: " + age);`
`System.out.println("Height: " + height);`
`System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);`
`System.out.println("Student: " + isStudent);`

To summarize, today we learned what a data type is, that Java is strongly typed, about the eight primitive data types, non-primitive types, and type casting. Now you understand how Java stores data internally. In the next lesson, we will learn about operators in Java.
