Java Complete Foundation
This document is designed as a comprehensive clarification knowledge base for AI-
driven Java doubt resolution.
1. Introduction to Java
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle.
Key Characteristics:
• Platform Independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)
• Object-Oriented
• Secure and Robust
• Multithreaded
• Automatic Memory Management
Java Program Execution Flow:
1. Source Code (.java)
2. Compiled by javac → Bytecode (.class)
3. Executed by JVM
JDK: Development Kit
JRE: Runtime Environment
JVM: Executes bytecode
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Introduction)
Critical Thinking: Why does Java use a virtual machine instead of compiling directly to
machine code?
Creativity: Modify a Hello World program to print three personalized messages.
Communication: Explain JDK, JRE, and JVM using a real-world analogy.
Collaboration: One student draws execution flow, another explains it.
2. Variables and Data Types
Java is strongly typed. Every variable must declare its data type before usage.
Syntax:
datatype variableName = value;
Example:
int age = 25;
double salary = 50000.75;
char grade = 'A';
boolean isActive = true;
Variable Types:
• Local Variables
• Instance Variables
• Static Variables
Scope determines where a variable can be accessed.
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Variables)
Critical Thinking: What error occurs if a variable is used without initialization?
Creativity: Create a student profile program using 5 variables.
Communication: Explain variable scope with an example.
Collaboration: One writes variables, another predicts output.
3. Primitive Data Types
Java has 8 primitive types:
byte (1 byte) – small integers
short (2 bytes) – medium integers
int (4 bytes) – most common integer
long (8 bytes) – very large integers (requires L suffix)
float (4 bytes) – decimal (requires f suffix)
double (8 bytes) – high precision decimal
char (2 bytes) – single character (Unicode supported)
boolean – true or false
Example:
int number = 10;
long population = 8000000000L;
float price = 19.99f;
double pi = 3.14159;
char grade = 'A';
boolean passed = true;
Memory Allocation:
Primitive types store actual values directly in memory.
Type Casting in Detail
Widening (Implicit Casting):
Smaller type automatically converts to larger type.
Example:
int x = 10;
double y = x;
Narrowing (Explicit Casting):
Larger type converted to smaller type manually.
Example:
double value = 9.7;
int result = (int) value;
Note: Narrowing may cause data loss.
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Primitive Types)
Critical Thinking: Why is double preferred over float in financial calculations?
Creativity: Design a temperature converter using type casting.
Communication: Explain narrowing casting with a real-world example.
Collaboration: One writes casting code, another checks edge cases.
4. Non-Primitive Data Types
Non-primitive types store references to memory locations.
Examples:
• String
• Arrays
• Classes
• Interfaces
• Objects
String Example:
String name = "Java";
Arrays Example:
int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4};
Difference:
Primitive → Direct value storage
Non-Primitive → Memory reference storage
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Non-Primitive Types)
Critical Thinking: Why are Strings immutable in Java?
Creativity: Create an array of marks and calculate average.
Communication: Explain reference vs value using an analogy.
Collaboration: One declares array, another writes loop to print.
5. Operators in Java
Arithmetic Operators: + - * / %
Relational Operators: == != > < >= <=
Logical Operators: && || !
Assignment Operators: = += -= *= /= %=
Unary Operators: ++ --
Ternary Operator: condition ? value1 : value2
Example:
int a = 10;
int b = 5;
System.out.println(a + b);
Common Mistake:
Using = instead of == inside conditions.
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Operators)
Critical Thinking: What logical error occurs if operator precedence is misunderstood?
Creativity: Build a calculator supporting all arithmetic operators.
Communication: Explain && vs || using traffic rules example.
Collaboration: One writes condition, another tests multiple inputs.
6. Control Flow Statements
if, if-else, nested if, switch statements control decision making.
Example:
if(age >= 18){
System.out.println("Adult");
}else{
System.out.println("Minor");
}
Switch Example:
switch(day){
case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break;
default: System.out.println("Invalid");
}
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Control Flow)
Critical Thinking: Why is break necessary in switch statements?
Creativity: Create grading system using if-else.
Communication: Compare switch and if-else logically.
Collaboration: Convert switch to if-else.
7. Loops
Loops repeat a block of code.
for Loop:
for(int i=0; i<5; i++){
System.out.println(i);
}
while Loop:
int i=0;
while(i<5){
System.out.println(i);
i++;
}
do-while Loop executes at least once.
break stops loop execution.
continue skips current iteration.
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Loops)
Critical Thinking: What causes infinite loops?
Creativity: Generate multiplication table using loop.
Communication: Explain difference between while and do-while.
Collaboration: One writes loop, another inserts break logic.
8. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
Class – Blueprint
Object – Instance of class
Constructor – Initializes object
Encapsulation – Data hiding using private variables
Inheritance – One class inherits another
Polymorphism – Same method, different behavior
Abstraction – Hiding internal implementation
Example:
class Student {
String name;
int age;
}
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (OOP)
Critical Thinking: Why is encapsulation important for security?
Creativity: Design a BankAccount class.
Communication: Explain inheritance using family example.
Collaboration: One writes class, another creates object.
9. Exception Handling
Exceptions are runtime errors.
Example:
try{
int a = 10/0;
}catch(Exception e){
System.out.println("Error occurred");
}finally{
System.out.println("Program ended");
}
Types:
• Checked Exceptions
• Unchecked Exceptions
AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Exceptions)
Critical Thinking: Why is exception handling necessary in production systems?
Creativity: Handle user input errors.
Communication: Explain difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
Collaboration: One creates exception, another handles it.
