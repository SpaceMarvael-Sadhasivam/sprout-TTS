## 1. Introduction to Java

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 and now maintained by Oracle.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   Platform Independent, often summarized as "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
*   Object-Oriented.
*   Secure and Robust.
*   Multithreaded.
*   And, it features Automatic Memory Management.

**Java Program Execution Flow:**
1.  Source Code, a `.java` file.
2.  Compiled by `javac`, which results in Bytecode, a `.class` file.
3.  And finally, Executed by the JVM.

**Definitions:**
*   JDK: Development Kit.
*   JRE: Runtime Environment.
*   JVM: Executes bytecode.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Introduction)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why does Java use a virtual machine instead of compiling directly to machine code?
*   **Creativity:** Modify a Hello World program to print three personalized messages.
*   **Communication:** Explain JDK, JRE, and JVM using a real-world analogy.
*   **Collaboration:** One student draws the execution flow, and another explains it.

## 2. Variables and Data Types

Java is strongly typed. Every variable must declare its data type before usage.

**Syntax:**
The syntax is: `datatype variableName = value;`

**Example:**
*   `int age = 25;`
*   `double salary = 50000.75;`
*   `char grade = 'A';`
*   `boolean isActive = true;`

**Variable Types:**
*   Local Variables.
*   Instance Variables.
*   Static Variables.

Scope determines where a variable can be accessed.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Variables)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** What error occurs if a variable is used without initialization?
*   **Creativity:** Create a student profile program using five variables.
*   **Communication:** Explain variable scope with an example.
*   **Collaboration:** One writes variables, another predicts the output.

## 3. Primitive Data Types

Java has eight primitive types:
*   `byte`: one byte, for small integers.
*   `short`: two bytes, for medium integers.
*   `int`: four bytes, the most common integer type.
*   `long`: eight bytes, for very large integers, which requires an L suffix.
*   `float`: four bytes, for decimal numbers, which requires an F suffix.
*   `double`: eight bytes, for high-precision decimal numbers.
*   `char`: two bytes, for a single character, with Unicode support.
*   `boolean`: for true or false values.

**Example:**
*   `int number = 10;`
*   `long population = 8000000000L;`
*   `float price = 19.99f;`
*   `double pi = 3.14159;`
*   `char grade = 'A';`
*   `boolean passed = true;`

**Memory Allocation:**
Primitive types store their actual values directly in memory.

### Type Casting in Detail

**Widening (Implicit Casting):**
A smaller type automatically converts to a larger type.

**Example:**
*   `int x = 10;`
*   `double y = x;`

**Narrowing (Explicit Casting):**
A larger type is converted to a smaller type manually.

**Example:**
*   `double value = 9.7;`
*   `int result = (int) value;`

**Note:** Narrowing may cause data loss.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Primitive Types)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why is `double` preferred over `float` in financial calculations?
*   **Creativity:** Design a temperature converter using type casting.
*   **Communication:** Explain narrowing casting with a real-world example.
*   **Collaboration:** One writes casting code, another checks edge cases.

## 4. Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive types store references to memory locations.

**Examples:**
*   String
*   Arrays
*   Classes
*   Interfaces
*   Objects

**String Example:**
`String name = "Java";`

**Arrays Example:**
`int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};`

**Difference:**
*   Primitive types: direct value storage.
*   Non-Primitive types: memory reference storage.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Non-Primitive Types)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why are Strings immutable in Java?
*   **Creativity:** Create an array of marks and calculate the average.
*   **Communication:** Explain reference versus value using an analogy.
*   **Collaboration:** One declares an array, another writes a loop to print it.

## 5. Operators in Java

*   **Arithmetic Operators:** Plus, Minus, Multiply, Divide, Modulus.
*   **Relational Operators:** Equals Equals, Not Equals, Greater Than, Less Than, Greater Than or Equals, Less Than or Equals.
*   **Logical Operators:** Logical AND, Logical OR, Logical NOT.
*   **Assignment Operators:** Equals, Plus Equals, Minus Equals, Multiply Equals, Divide Equals, Modulus Equals.
*   **Unary Operators:** Plus Plus (for increment), Minus Minus (for decrement).
*   **Ternary Operator:** `condition ? value1 : value2`

**Example:**
*   `int a = 10;`
*   `int b = 5;`
*   `System.out.println(a + b);`

**Common Mistake:**
Using a single equals sign instead of a double equals sign inside conditions.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Operators)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** What logical error occurs if operator precedence is misunderstood?
*   **Creativity:** Build a calculator supporting all arithmetic operators.
*   **Communication:** Explain logical AND versus logical OR using a traffic rules example.
*   **Collaboration:** One writes a condition, another tests multiple inputs.

## 6. Control Flow Statements

`if`, `if-else`, `nested if`, and `switch` statements control decision making.

**Example:**
*   `if (age >= 18) { System.out.println("Adult"); } else { System.out.println("Minor"); }`
    (Meaning: If age is greater than or equal to eighteen, print "Adult". Else, print "Minor".)

**Switch Example:**
*   `switch (day) { case 1: System.out.println("Monday"); break; default: System.out.println("Invalid"); }`
    (Meaning: For a given day, if it's case one, print "Monday" and break. By default, print "Invalid".)

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Control Flow)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why is `break` necessary in `switch` statements?
*   **Creativity:** Create a grading system using `if-else` statements.
*   **Communication:** Compare `switch` and `if-else` statements logically.
*   **Collaboration:** Convert a `switch` statement to an `if-else` statement.

## 7. Loops

Loops repeat a block of code.

**For Loop:**
*   `for (int i=0; i<5; i++) { System.out.println(i); }`
    (Meaning: For integer `i` starting at zero; as long as `i` is less than five; increment `i`: print `i`.)

**While Loop:**
*   `int i=0; while (i<5) { System.out.println(i); i++; }`
    (Meaning: Integer `i` equals zero. While `i` is less than five: print `i`, then increment `i`.)

A `do-while` loop executes at least once.
`break` stops loop execution.
`continue` skips the current iteration.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Loops)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** What causes infinite loops?
*   **Creativity:** Generate a multiplication table using a loop.
*   **Communication:** Explain the difference between a `while` and a `do-while` loop.
*   **Collaboration:** One writes a loop, another inserts `break` logic.

## 8. Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

*   **Class:** A blueprint.
*   **Object:** An instance of a class.
*   **Constructor:** Initializes an object.
*   **Encapsulation:** Data hiding using private variables.
*   **Inheritance:** When one class inherits another.
*   **Polymorphism:** The same method, with different behavior.
*   **Abstraction:** Hiding internal implementation.

**Example:**
*   `class Student { String name; int age; }`
    (Meaning: A class called `Student` contains a String for `name` and an integer for `age`.)

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (O O P)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why is encapsulation important for security?
*   **Creativity:** Design a `BankAccount` class.
*   **Communication:** Explain inheritance using a family example.
*   **Collaboration:** One writes a class, another creates an object.

## 9. Exception Handling

Exceptions are runtime errors.

**Example:**
*   `try { int a = 10/0; } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println("Error occurred"); } finally { System.out.println("Program ended"); }`
    (Meaning: In a try block, if integer `a` equals ten divided by zero; catch the exception `e`, and print "Error occurred". Finally, print "Program ended".)

**Types:**
*   Checked Exceptions.
*   Unchecked Exceptions.

**AI Tutor – 4C Questions (Exceptions)**
*   **Critical Thinking:** Why is exception handling necessary in production systems?
*   **Creativity:** Handle user input errors.
*   **Communication:** Explain the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions.
*   **Collaboration:** One creates an exception, another handles it.
