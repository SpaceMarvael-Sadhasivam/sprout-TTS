Python Basics

Why Python?

Python is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly programming languages. It's also versatile, used in web development, data science, AI, automation, and more. Plus, it has a huge community and lots of libraries to help you build almost anything.

Variables

A variable is like a box with a name. You put something inside the box, like a number or word. The name on the box helps you find what’s inside later.

Variable Naming Rules:
First, start with a letter or underscore.
Example: `name`, `_score`.

Second, variables are not allowed to start with a number. For example, `1age` is incorrect. Variables can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Example: `age1`, `student_name`.

Third, no spaces are allowed. Use an underscore instead of a space.
Example: `first_name` (correct), `first name` (wrong).

Fourth, you cannot use Python reserved keywords. Words like `if`, `for`, `while`, `class` cannot be variable names.

Fifth, variable names are case-sensitive. `Age` and `age` are different variables.

Sixth, keep names meaningful. Use names that describe what the variable holds, like `score` or `student_age`.

Example:
`name = "Sprout"`
`student = 900`

The `name` box holds "Sprout".
The `student` box holds 900.

You can use the box’s name to get the value. For example:
`print ("Hello, " + name)`

Output:
Hello, Sprout

How to Initialize a Variable Using the Assignment Operator:
First, choose a variable name.
Then, use the assignment operator, which is the equals sign, to give it a value.

Syntax:
`Variable_name = value`

Example:
`name = "Sprout"`
`location = “Coimbatore”`
`age = 6`

Explanation:
This stores the word "Sprout" in the variable `name`.
It stores the word "Coimbatore" in the variable `location`.
And it stores the number 6 in the variable `age`.

Collaboration: Work with a peer: one writes code for name and age, another adds hobbies.

Data Types

What Are Data Types?
When we create a variable, Python needs to know what kind of value is stored inside. That “kind” is called a data type.

Imagine a school bag:
If you put books in it, it becomes a book bag.
If you put snacks, it becomes a lunch bag.
In Python, the type of value decides the data type of the variable.

Data Type Descriptions:
Integer, or `int`, for whole numbers. Example: 5, negative 10, 0.
Float, for decimal numbers. Example: 3.14, negative 0.5.
Boolean, or `bool`, for True/False values. Example: True, False.
String, or `str`, for text data. Example: "Hello", '123'.

Syntax:
`variable_name = value`

Integer (int)

What is an Integer?
An integer is a whole number, with no decimals. It can be positive, like 5, 100. Negative, like negative 7, negative 22. Or zero.

Syntax:
`variable_name = integer_value`

Example Program:
`age = 5`
`year = 2020`
`print("Age:", age)`
`print("Year:", year)`

Explanation:
When `age` is 5, we’re storing a whole number in the variable `age`, so that’s an integer. Similarly, `year` is 2020. Years are whole numbers, so again this is an integer. We use `print()` to display them.

AI Tutor Questions:

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Thinking: Why would using a float instead of an integer cause issues when you're counting people in a classroom?
Creativity: Design a small student info card using integers like `roll_number`, `age`, and `grade`. Print the values and share it.
Communication: If a user enters their age as a float, for example, 10.5, how would you explain to them why the system needs an integer?
Collaboration: Work with a friend to create a program that accepts a student’s roll number and age, then prints a welcome message.

Float (Decimal Numbers)

What is a Float?
A float is a number that has a decimal point. Examples: 3.14, 0.5, negative 7.25. We use floats when we need precision, like in money, temperature, or measurements.

Syntax:
`variable_name = decimal_value`

Example Program:
`price = 49.99`
`temperature = -2.5`
`height = 5.8`
`print("Price:", price)`
`print("Temperature:", temperature)`
`print("Height:", height)`

Explanation:
`price` at 49.99 is a float because it has a decimal. This is useful when dealing with money. `temperature` at negative 2.5 is still a float because of the decimal point, even though it’s negative. `height` at 5.8. Height is often measured in points or inches, so a float makes sense.

Communication: Explain to someone new to programming why 3.0 and 3 are stored differently in memory.
Collaboration: Pair up and create a weather report generator that stores today's temperature, humidity, and wind speed using floats.

Boolean (True or False)

What is a Boolean?
A Boolean is a special data type that has only two possible values: True or False. We use it for decisions, like: Is a student present? Has the user logged in? Or, is the number greater than 10?

Syntax:
`variable_name = True`
or
`variable_name = False`

Example Program:
`is_logged_in = True`
`is_holiday = False`
`passed_exam = True`
`print("User logged in:", is_logged_in)`
`print("Is today a holiday?", is_holiday)`
`print("Passed the exam:", passed_exam)`

Explanation:
`is_logged_in` is True, meaning the user has logged in. `is_holiday` is False, because today is not a holiday. `passed_exam` is True, indicating this student passed.

Strings

What is a String?
A string is simply a sequence of characters, like words or sentences, inside quotes. It can contain letters, numbers, and symbols. You can think of a string like a sentence written on a ribbon. Each character has a place, called an index, and you can pull characters out or change them around.

Creating a String

Syntax:
`text = "sprout"`
or
`text = 'Brighter tomorrow'`

Example:
`greeting = "Welcome to sprout"`
`print(greeting)`

Output:
Welcome to sprout

Explanation:
The variable `greeting` stores a message, which is a string. The `print()` function displays it.

String Indexing
Each character in a string has a position number, or index, starting from zero.

Example:
`word = "Sprout"`
`print(word[0])` (This gets the first letter.)
`print(word[5])` (This gets the last letter.)

Output:
S
t

Explanation:
`word` bracket zero gives the first character.
`word` bracket five gives the sixth character, because index starts from zero.

String Slicing
You can cut out parts of a string using slicing.

Syntax:
`string[start:end]`

Example:
`msg = "HelloSprout"`
`print(msg[0:5])` (This goes from index zero to four.)

Output:
Hello

Explanation:
This starts from index zero and goes up to, but not including, index five.

Common String Methods
Python gives many built-in methods to work with strings.

Method Description
`lower()`: Converts to lowercase.
`upper()`: Converts to uppercase.
`strip()`: Removes spaces at ends.
`replace()`: Replaces part of the string.
`split()`: Breaks string into a list.
`find()`: Finds the index of a character.
`len()`: Returns length of string.

Example Program Using String Methods:
`name = " Python Programming "`

1. `print(name.strip())` (This removes spaces.)
2. `print(name.lower())` (This makes it lowercase.)
3. `print(name.upper())` (This makes it uppercase.)
4. `print(name.replace("Python", "Java"))` (This replaces a word.)
5. `print(len(name))` (This counts characters, including spaces.)

Output:
1. Python Programming
2. python programming
3. PYTHON PROGRAMMING
4. Java Programming
5. 24

f-Strings (Formatted Strings)
f-strings are used to combine variables with strings in a neat way.

Example:
`name = "Sprout"`
`age = 5`
`print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")`

Output:
My name is sprout and I am 5 years old.

Explanation:
The `f` before the string lets you place variables inside curly braces.

Operators

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Think of them as action signs like `+` for addition or `==` for checking if two things are equal.

Types of Operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators
These are used for basic math operations:
`+` for Addition
`-` for Subtraction
`*` for Multiplication
`/` for Division
`%` for Modulus, which gives the remainder
`**` for Exponent, which is power
`//` for Floor division, which is division rounded down

Syntax:
`a + b`: adds two numbers
`a - b`: subtracts b from a
`a * b`: multiplies a and b
`a / b`: divides a by b; the result can be a decimal
`a % b`: gives the remainder when a is divided by b
`a ** b`: raises a to the power of b
`a // b`: divides a by b and gives only the whole number part

Example Programs:
`x = 15`
`y = 4`

Output for `x + y` is 19.

Explanation:
Think of addition as putting two numbers together. Here, 15 plus 4 makes 19.
Subtraction means you take one number away from another. 15 minus 4 leaves 11.
Multiplication is like adding a number many times. 15 times 4 is 60.
Division is splitting a number into equal parts. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, which is not a whole number, so you get a decimal.
Modulus gives the leftover after dividing. When 15 is divided by 4, the leftover, or remainder, is 3.
Exponent means power, raising a number to another’s power. 15 to the power of 4, or 15 to the fourth power, is 50,625.
Floor division divides and keeps only the whole number part, ignoring decimals. 15 divided by 4 is 3.75, but floor division gives 3.

2. Comparison Operators
These are used to compare two values and return True or False:
`==` for Equal to
`!=` for Not equal to
`>` for Greater than
`<` for Less than
`>=` for Greater than or equal to
`<=` for Less than or equal to

Syntax:
`a == b`: checks if a is equal to b
`a != b`: checks if a is not equal to b
`a > b`: checks if a is greater than b
`a < b`: checks if a is less than b
`a >= b`: checks if a is greater than or equal to b
`a <= b`: checks if a is less than or equal to b

Example program:
`x = 10`
`y = 20`
`equal = (x == y)`
`not_equal = (x != y)`
`greater = (x > y)`
`less = (x < y)`
`greater_equal = (x >= y)`
`less_equal = (x <= y)`

Explanation:
`equal` checks if 10 is the same as 20. Since they are different, it is False.
`not_equal` checks if 10 is different from 20. Since they are different, it is True.
`greater` checks if 10 is bigger than 20. It’s not, so it is False.
`less` checks if 10 is smaller than 20. It is, so it is True.
`greater_equal` checks if 10 is bigger or the same as 20. It’s not, so False.
`less_equal` checks if 10 is smaller or the same as 20. Since 10 is smaller, it is True.

3. Logical Operators
These are used to combine conditional statements:
`and`: Both conditions True
`or`: At least one condition True
`not`: Reverses the result

Syntax:
`a and b`: True if both a and b are True
`a or b`: True if either a or b is True
`not a`: True if a is False, and False if a is True; it reverses the value

Example:
`x = True`
`y = False`
`and_result = x and y`
`or_result = x or y`
`not_result = not x`

Explanation:
`and_result` asks: "Are both x and y True?" Here, x is True but y is False, so the answer is False because both must be True for `and` to be True.
`or_result` asks: "Is either x or y True?" Since x is True, it doesn’t matter what y is; `or` says True if any one is True.
`not_result` flips the value of x. Since x is True, `not x` becomes False. It’s like saying “not True” equals False.

4. Assignment Operators
These are used to assign or update values:
`=`: Simple assignment
`+=`: Add and assign
`- =`: Subtract and assign
`* =`: Multiply and assign
`/ =`: Divide and assign
`%=`: Modulus and assign

Syntax:
`a = b`: Assigns value of b to a.
`a += b`: Adds b to a, then assigns result to a; this is the same as `a = a + b`.
`a -= b`: Subtracts b from a, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a - b`.
`a *= b`: Multiplies a by b, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a * b`.
`a /= b`: Divides a by b, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a / b`.
`a %= b`: Takes modulus of a by b, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a % b`.
`a **= b`: Raises a to power b, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a ** b`.
`a //= b`: Floor divides a by b, then assigns to a; this is the same as `a = a // b`.

Example program:
`a = 10`
`a += 5`
Now `a` becomes 10 plus 5, which equals 15.
`a -= 3`
Now `a` becomes 15 minus 3, which equals 12.
`a *= 2`
Now `a` becomes 12 times 2, which equals 24.
`a /= 4`
Now `a` becomes 24 divided by 4, which equals 6.0.
`a %= 4`
Now `a` becomes 6.0 modulus 4, which equals 2.0.

Explanation:
`a = 10` means we start by giving the value 10 to variable `a`.
`a += 5` means “add 5 to a” and update `a` with this new value, so `a` becomes 15.
`a -= 3` means “subtract 3 from a” and update `a`, so now `a` is 12.
`a *= 2` means “multiply a by 2” and update `a` to 24.
`a /= 4` means “divide a by 4” and update `a` to 6.0. Notice it becomes a float.
`a %= 4` means “get the remainder when `a` is divided by 4” and update `a` to 2.0.

Identity Operators
These check if two variables point to the same object:
`is`: Returns True if they are the same object.
`is not`: Returns True if they are not the same object.

Syntax:
`a is b`: True if a and b refer to the same object.
`a is not b`: True if a and b do NOT refer to the same object.

Example program:
`x = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]`
`y = ["sprout", "coimbatore"]`
`z = x`
`print(x is y)`: This is False.
`print(x is z)`: This is True.
`print(x is not y)`: This is True.

Explanation:
`x` and `y` have the same contents, but they are different objects in memory, so `x is y` is False.
`z` is assigned to `x`, so both `z` and `x` point to the same object, making `x is z` True.
Since `x` and `y` are not the same object, `x is not y` is True.

5. Membership Operators
These check if a value is present in a sequence, like a list or string:
`in`: Returns True if present.
`not in`: Returns True if not present.

Syntax:
`item in sequence`: True if item is found inside the sequence.
`item not in sequence`: True if item is NOT found inside the sequence.

Example program:
`fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`
`print("banana" in fruits)`
Answer: True
`print("mango" in fruits)`
Answer: False
`print("grape" not in fruits)`
Answer: True

Explanation:
`"banana" in fruits` checks if "banana" is inside the list `fruits`. Since it is, the answer is True.
`"mango" in fruits` asks if "mango" is in the list. It’s not there, so the answer is False.
`"grape" not in fruits` asks if "grape" is NOT in the list. Because it’s not present, this is True.

Control Flow

Control flow helps your program decide which code to run based on conditions. It’s like making choices!

The if-else Statement

Syntax:
`if condition:`
  `code to run if condition is True`
`else:`
  `code to run if condition is False`

Example program:
`age = 18`
`if age >= 18:`
  `print("You are eligible to vote.")`
`else:`
  `print("You eligible not to vote.")`

Explanation:
The program checks if `age` is 18 or more.
If True, it prints “You are eligible to vote.”
If False, it prints “You eligible not to vote.”

AI Tutor Question:

Communication: How would you explain the concept of `if-elif-else` to a 10-year-old using a daily example?
Collaboration: With a partner, write a program that checks if today is a holiday, a weekend, or a working day.

Nested if Statement

You can put an `if` statement inside another `if`. This is called a nested `if`.

Syntax:
`if condition1:`
  `if condition2:`
    `//code if both conditions are True`

Example program:
`age = 20`
`is_registered = True`
`if age >= 18:`
  `if is_registered:`
    `print("You are eligible to vote.")`
  `else:`
    `print("You need to register to vote.")`
`else:`
  `print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")`

Explanation:
First, it checks if the person is 18 or older, which is the voting age.
If yes, it then checks if they are registered to vote.
If registered, it prints “You are eligible to vote.”
If not registered, it reminds them to register.
If under 18, it says they are not eligible yet.

Creativity: Design a game scenario where two conditions decide the next level.
Communication: Explain how nesting works with a real-world analogy, like school grades and age.
Collaboration: Partner one writes the outer `if`, Partner two writes a nested logic for eligibility.

Ternary Operator (Short if-else)

When you want a quick decision in one line, use the ternary operator.

Syntax:
`value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`

Example program:
`age = 16`
`message = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"`
`print(message)`

Explanation:
It checks if `age` is 18 or more.
If yes, `message` becomes "Adult".
If no, `message` becomes "Minor".
Then it prints the message.

Creativity: Create a ternary check that returns "Pass" or "Fail" based on marks.
Communication: Convert a ternary into a normal `if-else` and explain both versions.
Collaboration: One writes the ternary version, the other writes the regular version. Then compare them.

Loops

Loops help you repeat a block of code again, either a specific number of times or until a condition is met.

while Loop
Use a `while` loop when you don’t know exactly how many times to repeat. Just keep going as long as the condition is True.

Syntax:
`while condition:`
  `//code to repeat`

Example:
`count = 1`
`while count <= 5:`
  `print("Count is:", count)`
  `count += 1`

Explanation:
Start with `count` equals 1.
The loop checks: Is `count` less than or equal to 5?
If yes, it prints the value and increases `count` by 1.
This repeats until `count` becomes 6, then it stops.

Critical Thinking: What would happen if you forget to update the counter in a `while` loop? Try it.
Creativity: Make a pattern printer using nested loops, for example, a triangle of stars.
Communication: Explain to a beginner how `break` and `continue` affect loop flow with examples.
Collaboration: One writes a `for` loop that lists numbers, the other adds logic to skip odds.

for Loop
Use a `for` loop when you know how many times you want to repeat, often with a list or range of numbers.

Syntax:
`for variable in sequence:`
  `//code to repeat`

Example program:
`for i in range(1, 6):`
  `print("Number:", i)`

Explanation:
`range` one comma six gives numbers from 1 to 5.
Each time, `i` takes the next number.
It prints `i` from 1 to 5.

AI Tutor Questions:

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Thinking: What happens if your range is off-by-one? Can you fix an off-by-one error?
Creativity: Make a countdown from 10 to 1 using a `for` loop.
Communication: Teach a friend how `range(start, stop)` works with an example.
Collaboration: One writes a loop printing even numbers; the other handles odd numbers.

break Statement
`break` is used to stop a loop early when a condition is met.

Example:
`for i in range(1, 10):`
  `if i == 5:`
    `break`
  `print(i)`

Explanation:
This loop prints numbers starting from 1.
But when `i` becomes 5, `break` stops the loop.
The output will be 1, 2, 3, 4.

continue Statement
`continue` is used to skip the current loop step and move to the next one.

Example:
`for i in range(1, 6):`
  `if i == 3:`
    `continue`
  `print(i)`

Explanation:
This prints numbers from 1 to 5.
But when `i` is 3, it skips printing and goes to the next.
The output will be 1, 2, 4, 5, because 3 is skipped.

AI Tutor Questions:

Critical Thinking: What would happen if `continue` is placed before a critical `print` statement?
Creativity: Use `continue` to skip printing vowels from a word.
Communication: Explain the role of `continue` in controlling loop behavior.
Collaboration: One writes the loop, the other adds `continue` to handle a specific condition.

else with Loops
You can use `else` after a loop. It runs only if the loop completes normally, meaning it was not stopped by a `break` statement.

Example:
`for i in range(1, 4):`
  `print("Checking:", i)`
`else:`
  `print("Loop completed.")`

Explanation:
It prints numbers 1 to 3.
Then, since the loop finished without a `break`, the `else` block runs.
The output ends with “Loop completed.”

Critical Thinking: What happens if you add a `break` inside a loop with `else`?
Creativity: Build a number search loop with an `else` that says "Not found!".
Communication: Explain how `loop else` differs from `if-else`.
Collaboration: One writes a loop to find a number, the other adds `else` for a post-loop message.

Functions

Functions are like mini programs inside your program. You write the code once, give it a name, and then reuse it anytime by calling it.

`def` and `return` Syntax

Syntax:
`def function_name():`
  `# code inside the function`
  `return result`

Example:
`def greet():`
  `return "Hello, sprout"`
`message = greet()`
`print(message)`

Explanation:
`def greet()` creates a function named `greet`.
`return "Hello, sprout"` sends back a message when the function is called.
`greet()` is called, and the result is stored in `message`.
Then we print it.

AI Tutor Question:

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Thinking: Why use functions instead of repeating the same code in multiple places? Give an example.
Creativity: Create a `describe_pet` function that prints info based on the name and type of pet.
Communication: Teach someone how to define and call a function using your own simple example.
Collaboration: One writes a function to calculate squares of numbers, the other adds input logic and testing.

Function with Parameters

You can pass values, called parameters, into a function.

Syntax:
`def greet(name):`
  `print("Hello,", name)`

Example:
`def greet(name):`
  `print("Hello,", name)`
`greet("sprout")`

Explanation:
The function expects a value called `name`.
When you call `greet("sprout")`, it prints: "Hello, sprout".

Critical Thinking: What happens if you forget to pass one of the required arguments to a function?
Creativity: Design a `make_card(name, age)` function that prints a greeting card message.
Communication: Explain the difference between a parameter and an argument to a peer.
Collaboration: One partner writes a function with two parameters, the other tests it with various values.

`*args` – Variable Number of Arguments
Use asterisk `args` to send a list of values to a function.

Syntax:
`def add_numbers(*args):`
  `# args behaves like a tuple`

Example:
`def add_numbers(*args):`
  `total = 0`
  `for num in args:`
    `total += num`
  `return total`
`print(add_numbers(10, 20, 30))`

Explanation:
Asterisk `args` allows the function to accept any number of values.
It adds 10 plus 20 plus 30 and returns 60.

`**kwargs` – Keyword Arguments
Use double asterisk `kwargs` to pass values with names, or keys.

Example:
`def print_info(**kwargs):`
  `for key, value in kwargs.items():`
    `print(key, ":", value)`
`print_info(name="Sprout", age=6)`

Explanation:
Double asterisk `kwargs` lets you pass data like a dictionary, using key-value pairs.
Here, `name="Sprout"` and `age=6` are passed to the function.
The function prints each key-value pair.

AI Tutor Question:
First question: How does using asterisk `args` help when you don’t know how many arguments you’ll need? Can you create a function that takes in any number of scores and returns their average?
Second question: Collaborate on writing a flexible report generator using double asterisk `kwargs`. Try different inputs and discuss.

4C AI Tutor Questions

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Thinking: Why would using asterisk `args` or double asterisk `kwargs` be better than fixed parameters in some cases? Give an example.
Creativity: Create a `log_event` function that uses double asterisk `kwargs` to log events with keys like user, time, and action.
Communication: Explain to a friend the difference between asterisk `args` and double asterisk `kwargs` using your own analogy.
Collaboration: One student writes a function using asterisk `args`, another adds double asterisk `kwargs`, and they combine use cases.

Lambda Functions (Short One-Line Functions)

Use `lambda` when you want a small, one-time function.

Syntax:
`lambda arguments: expression`

Example:
`square = lambda x: x * x`
`print(square(5))`

Explanation:
`lambda x: x * x` creates a small function to square a number.
`square` five returns 25.

AI Tutor Question:

4C Skill AI Tutor Question
Critical Thinking: Compare a regular function with a `lambda` function. When should you use each one?
Creativity: Create a `lambda` function that takes a number and returns "Even" or "Odd".
Communication: Teach your partner how to convert a normal function into a `lambda` function using a simple example.
Collaboration: One student writes a `lambda` to sort a list of names; the other provides test cases.

Variable Scope (Local and Global)

Variables inside functions are local, meaning they can’t be used outside.

Example:
`def my_func():`
  `x = 10`
  `print("Inside:", x)`
`my_func()`
`print("Outside:", x)` (This will cause an error.)

Explanation:
`x` equals 10 is created inside the function.
When you try to use it outside, Python gives an error.
It means variables have a scope, or an area of life.

Critical Thinking: Why might using too many global variables lead to errors in a big program? Give an example.
Creativity: Write a small game setup function where a local variable holds the player's name and prints it.
Communication: Explain to a friend how local and global variables differ. Use your own example.
Collaboration: One student writes a global variable; the other writes a function to modify it using the `global` keyword.
