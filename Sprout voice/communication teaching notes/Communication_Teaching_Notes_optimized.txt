Welcome to the session on Communication.

The objective of this session is that by the end, students will be able to introduce themselves confidently, clearly, and in a structured manner without memorizing.

To begin, start with a model introduction:
"Good morning everyone.
My name is Aparna.
I am from Chennai.
I work as an English trainer.
I have been training students for the past five years.
I am passionate about helping students improve their communication skills.
My goal is to help each one of you become confident speakers.
Thank you."

Now, pause. Then, ask your students:
"Did you notice I spoke slowly?
Did you notice I paused after every sentence?
Did you notice I used simple English?"

Next, explain that fluency does not mean speed. Fluency means clarity.

Now, we'll cover the structure. Write the following structure on the board:
Greeting
Name
Place
Education / Profession
One Interest
Goal
Closing

Explain each step clearly.

Step one: Greeting. Say, "Good morning," or "Good afternoon."

Step two: Name. Say, "My name is Ravi." Do not say, "Myself Ravi."

Step three: Place. For example, "I am from Coimbatore."

Step four: Education or Profession. If you're in school, you might say, "I am studying in 10th standard." For college, "I am pursuing B.Sc Computer Science, second year." If working, "I work as a software developer."

Step five: One Interest. Mention only one interest.

Step six: Goal. For example, "My goal is to become a confident speaker."

And finally, step seven: Closing. Always end with, "Thank you."

Next, for a live mistake demonstration. Say an incorrect version, such as:
"Myself Ravi. I am coming from Coimbatore. My hobbies are cricket, dancing, singing, reading books, watching movies. Sorry for my bad English."

Then, correct it step by step.
Correction one: Instead of, "Myself Ravi," the correct way is, "My name is Ravi."
Correction two: Not, "I am coming from," but simply, "I am from."
Correction three: Do not list too many hobbies. Mention only one.
Correction four: Never start or end with an apology. Confidence comes first.

Explain why clarity is more important than complicated words.

Here are three sample introductions.
First, for a school student:
"Good morning.
My name is Karthik.
I am studying in 9th standard.
I am interested in science.
My goal is to become a doctor.
Thank you."

Next, for a college student:
"Good afternoon.
My name is Priya.
I am pursuing B.Com, second year.
I am interested in finance.
My goal is to work in a reputed company.
Thank you."

And finally, for a working professional:
"Good morning.
My name is Arun.
I work as a software engineer.
I am interested in learning new technologies.
My goal is to grow in my career.
Thank you."

Explain the differences clearly between these examples.

Now, let's practice speaking about your daily routine. Teach the following structure for daily routine practice:
Morning, then Afternoon, then Evening.

Here's a model answer:
"In the morning, I wake up at 6 a.m. and get ready for school.
In the afternoon, I attend my classes and complete assignments.
In the evening, I spend time with my family and revise my lessons."

Instruct your students: "Do not overthink. Describe what you actually did. Add details like time and activities."

Next, we'll cover confidence and body language. Teach the following points:
Maintain eye contact.
Stand straight.
Do not rush.
Pause naturally.
Do not memorize like a robot.
And avoid looking at the floor.

If students express nervousness, say: "Nervousness is normal. Confidence comes after repetition."

For practice, ask your students to rehearse once slowly.

To summarize this session: Your self-introduction is your first impression. Keep it short. Keep it structured. Speak clearly. And end confidently.

Remember this key principle: Simple English, plus Clear Structure, plus Confidence, equals Strong Communication.
